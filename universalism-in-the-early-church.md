# Dedication (1899)

To

**Rev J.S. Cantwell**

AS A TOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP OF MANY YEARS DURATION, AND AS A MERITED,
THOUGH AN INADEQUATE RECOGNITION OF LIFELONG AND VALUABLE SERVICE
RENDERED TO THE GREAT TRUTH TO WHICH THIS BOOK IS DEVOTED, IT IS
AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR.

# Dedication (2022)

To the Revs. Don Lyons and Bob Sheldon and to all those who led and
loved me at First Baptist Church of Westerlo. They may not agree with
this universalistic stance but they are the ones who taught me that God
is good.

# Foreword (2022)

I\'ve written and rewritten this introduction. I\'m trying to find the
right words but I haven\'t, so I\'ll settle for these.

I can think of no topic more important for the Christian than the nature
of God. It certainly has been a topic that has consumed my mind and life
for many years.

As long as I can remember I have believed God is good. For Christianity
to be true God must be good and I will only follow a good God. Thus I
have struggled and do struggle to believe that God exists because I
cannot always see/knew that God is good.[^3]

As a child I was raised in a fundamentalist, evangelical family. The
church community generally emphasized a free will (Arminian/Wesleyan)
perspective. God was good but humans were failing. God wanted to save
all but humans refused.

When I went off to college I entered a conservative, evangelical
community heavily oriented towards a deterministic
(Augustinian/Calvinistic) perspective. This nearly shipwrecked my faith.
I remember sitting on the grass on campus with Arminius\' works in my
lap crying out to God. I was spending my life for God, but was God good?

I no longer saw a human\'s will as able to frustrate God\'s
decisions[^4] - and if God was capable of saving everyone but didn\'t,
then God was choosing not to save everyone. If God chose not to save
everyone, that (to my mind) God could not be good.

I accidentally stumbled upon \"Christian Universalism,"[^5] I initially
rejected it immediately as outlandish and unbiblical. But, over time, I
found myself drawn back to studying this "Christian Universalism."

I eventually stumbled upon the works of John Wesley Hanson, a prolific
author during the 19th century who laid out in volume after volume the
Scriptural and historical foundations for universalistic belief.

One of those books is the one you are about to read - *Universalism in
the Early Church*. In this work Hanson provides copious documentation of
the presence of universalistic belief within the *orthodox* Christian
community of the early church.

I hope you will read this book with a discerning but open heart. It is
what I have attempted and continue to attempt to do. The vision of God
set forth by "Christian Universalism" is such as I desperately long for
God to be and for this very reason I have pressed and continue to press
on this vision to find it's weaknesses lest I have been deceived. I do
not want to form a god of my own making but to know the true God as I
expect do you.

May God grant us wisdom that we may know and love the true God.

Sincerely,

Dave Mackey,

November 5^th^, 2022.

## Beta Status

I believe this work is valuable and I wanted to ensure it was available
to you. It contains the substance of Hanson's original work and is
readable as it is. That said, I expect the work to continue to evolve. I
will continue to improve formatting, clarity, correct errors, add
footnotes, and so on.

In the past this might have been accomplished by publishing a few
different editions. This was due to the limitations of print. Since this
is an ebook there is no need for the major event of editions, rather the
evolution can be incremental. This allows me to release more
improvements to you quicker than is traditionally possible.

I believe there is value in this approach and I hope you will experience
this value as the work evolves over time. That said, it also means that
you will encounter words that have been bolded inconsistently at times,
some instances where a Greek phrase has yet to be brought over, etc.

If you find something particularly needful, please let me know. I will
endeavor to implement changes where readers desire at the highest
priority. You can reach me via email at <dave@davemackey.net>.

Note: You can see the end of this volume for details on what has changed
from the original version and various details of my methodology for
choosing what to change and how. I have been obsessive in my attempt to
respect the text while improving it's clarity.

# Foreword (1899)

The purpose of this book is to present some of the evidence of the
prevalence in the early centuries of the Christian church, of the
doctrine of the final holiness of all mankind.[^6] The author has
endeavored to give the language of the early Christians, rather than to
paraphrase their words, or state their sentiments in his own
language.[^7] He has also somewhat copiously quoted the statements of
modern scholars, historians and critics, of all shades of opinion,
instead of condensing them with his own pen.

The large number of extracts which this course necessitates gives his
pages a somewhat mosaic appearance, but he has preferred to sacrifice
mere literary form to what seems larger utility.

He has aimed to present irrefutable[^8] proofs that the doctrine of
Universal Salvation was the prevalent sentiment of the primitive
Christian church. He believes his investigation has been somewhat
thorough, for he has endeavored to consult not only all the fathers
themselves, but the most distinguished modern writers who have
considered the subject.

The first form of his manuscript contained a thousand copious notes,
with citations from the original Greek and Latin, but such an array was
thought by judicious friends too formidable to attract the average
reader, as well as too voluminous, and he has therefore retained only a
fraction of the notes he had prepared.

The opinions of Christians in the first few centuries should predispose
us to believe in their truthfulness, since[^9] they were nearest to the
divine Fountain of our religion. The doctrine of Universal Salvation was
nowhere taught until they inculcated it.[^10] Where could they have
obtained it but from the source whence they claim to have derived it ---
the New Testament?

The author believes that the following pages show that Universal
Restitution was the faith of the early Christians for at least the First
Five Hundred Years of the Christian Era.

# Introduction

The surviving writings of the Christian Fathers, of the first four or
five centuries of the Christian Era, abound in evidences of the
prevalence of the doctrine of universal salvation during those years.
This important fact in the history of Christian eschatology was first
brought out prominently in a very valuable volume (and for its time very
thorough): Hosea Ballou\'s *Ancient History of Universalism*.[^11] His
work has well been called \"light in a dark place,\"[^12] but the
quotations he makes are but a fraction of what subsequent researchers
have discovered. Referring to Ballou\'s third edition with \"Notes\" by
the A. St. John Chambré and Thomas J. Sawyer (1872), T. B. Thayer,
observes in the *Universalist Quarterly*, April, 1872:

"As regards the additions to the work by the editors, we must say that
they are not as numerous nor as extensive as we had hoped they might be.
It would seem as if the studies of our own scholars for more than forty
years since the first edition, and the many new and elaborate works on
the history of the church and its doctrines by eminent theologians and
critics, should have furnished more witnesses to the truth, and larger
extracts from the early literature of the church, than are found in the
'Notes.' With the exception of three or four of them no important
addition is made to the contents of the work. If the Notes are to be
considered as final, or the last gleanings of the field, it shows how
thoroughly Dr. Ballou did his work, notwithstanding the poverty of his
resources, and the many and great disadvantages attending his first
efforts. But we cannot help thinking that something remains still to be
said respecting some of the apostolic fathers[^13] and Chrysostom,
Augustine and others; as well as concerning the gnostic sects,[^14] the
report of whose opinions, it must be remembered, comes to us mostly from
their enemies, or at least those not friendly to them."

The want here indicated this volume aims to supply.

Dr. Ballou\'s work was followed in 1878 by Dr. Edward Beecher\'s
*History of the Doctrine of Future Retribution*, a most truthful and
candid volume, which adds much valuable material to that contained in
Dr. Ballou\'s work. About the same time **Frederick W. Farrar**
published *Eternal Hope* (1878) and *Mercy and Judgment* (1881),
containing additional testimony showing that many of the Christian
writers in the centuries immediately following our Lord and his
apostles, were Universalists.

In addition to these a contribution to the literature of the subject was
made by the Rev. Thomas Allin,[^15] a clergyman of the English Episcopal
Church, in a work entitled *Universalism Asserted*. Allin was led to his
study of the patristic literature by finding a copy of Dr. Ballou\'s
work in the British Museum. Incited by its contents he microscopically
searched the fathers and found many valuable statements that
incontestably prove that the most and the best of the successors of the
apostles inculcated the doctrine of universal salvation.

The defects of Allin\'s very scholarly work, from this writer\'s
standpoint are, that he writes as an Episcopalian, merely from the
viewpoint of the Nicene creed, to show by the example of the patristic
writers that one can remain an Episcopalian and cherish the hope of
universal salvation; and that he regards the doctrine as only a hope,
and not a distinct teaching of the Christian religion. Meanwhile, the
fact of the early prevalence of the doctrine has been brought out
incidentally in such works as the *Dictionary of Christian
Biography*,[^16] Farrar\'s *Lives of the Fathers*, and other books, the
salient statements and facts in all which will be found in these pages,
which show that the most and best and ablest of the early fathers found
the deliverance of all mankind from sin and sorrow specifically revealed
in the Christian Scriptures.

The author[^17] has not only quoted the words of the fathers themselves,
but he has studiously endeavored, instead of his own words, to reproduce
the language of historians, biographers, critics, scholars, and other
writers of all schools of thought, and to demonstrate by these
irrefutable[^18] testimonies that Universalism was the primitive
Christianity.

The quotations other references indicated by footnotes, will show the
reader that many volumes have been consulted, and it is believed by the
author that no important work in the copious literature of the theme has
been omitted.

The plan of this work does not contemplate the presentation of the
Scriptural evidence --- which to Universalists is demonstrative --- that
our Lord and his apostles taught the final and universal prevalence of
holiness and happiness. That work is thoroughly done in a library of
volumes in the literature of the Universalist Church. Neither is it the
purpose of the author of this book to write a history of the doctrine;
but his sole object is to show that those who obtained their religion
almost directly from the lips of its author, understood it to teach the
doctrine of universal salvation.

Not only are copious citations given from the ancient Universalists
themselves, but abstracts and compendiums of their opinions, and
testimonials as to their scholarship and saintliness, are presented from
the most eminent authors who have written of them. No equal number of
the church\'s early saints has ever received such glowing eulogies from
so many scholars and critics as the ancient Universalists have extorted
from such authors as Socrates, Neander, Mosheim, Huet, Dorner,
Dietelmaier, Beecher, Schaff, Plumptre, Bigg, Farrar, Bunsen, Cave,
Westcott, Robertson, Butler, Allen, De Pressense, Gieseler, Lardner,
Hagenbach, Blunt, and others, not professed Universalists.[^19] Their
eulogies found in these pages would alone justify the publication of
this volume.

# The Earliest Creeds.

An examination of the earliest Christian creeds and declarations of
Christian opinion discloses the fact that no formulary of Christian
Teaching of the belief for several centuries after Christ contained
anything incompatible with the broad faith of the Gospel --- the
universal redemption of mankind from sin.

## Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

The earliest of all the documents pertaining to this subject is the
*Teaching of the Twelve Apostles*.[^20] This work was discovered in
manuscript in the library of the Holy Sepulcher, in Constantinople, by
Philotheos Bryennios, and published in 1875. It was bound with
Chrysostom\'s *Synopsis of the Works of the Old Testament*, the *Epistle
of Barnabas*, 70-120 AD --- two epistles of Clement, and less important
works. The *Teaching of the Twelve Apostles* was quoted by Clement of
Alexandria, by Eusebius and by Athanasius, so that it must have been
recognized as early as 200 AD. It was undoubtedly composed between 120
and 160 AD. An American edition of the Greek text and an English
translation were published in New York in 1884, with notes by Roswell D.
Hitchcock[^21] and Francis Brown,[^22] professors at Union Theological
Seminary, New York, from which we quote. It is entirely silent on the
duration of punishment. It describes the two ways of life and death, in
its sixteen chapters, and indicates the rewards and the penalties of the
good way and of the evil way as any Universalist would do --- as Origen
and Basil did. God is thanked for giving spiritual food and drink and
"*aeonian* life."[^23]

The last chapter exhorts Christians to watch against the terrors and
judgments that shall come \"when the earth shall be given unto his (the
world deceiver\'s) hands. Then all created men shall come into the fire
of trial, and many shall be made to stumble and perish. But they that
endure in their faith shall be saved from this curse. And then shall
appear the signs of the truth; first, the sign of an opening in heaven;
then the sign of the trumpet\'s sound; and, thirdly, the resurrection
from the dead, yet not of all, but as it has been said: "The Lord will
come and all his saints with him. Then shall the world see the Lord
coming upon the clouds of heaven."[^24] This resurrection must be
regarded as a moral one, as it is not "of all the dead," but of the
saints only. There is not a whisper in this ancient document of endless
punishment, and its testimony, therefore, is that that dogma was not in
the second century regarded as a part of "the teaching of the apostles."

When describing the endlessness of being it uses the word *athanasias*,
but describes the glory of Christ, as do the Scriptures, as for ages
(*eis tous aionas*). In Chapter 11 occurs this language: "Every sin
shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be forgiven" (the sin of an
apostle asking money for his services); but that form of expression is
clearly in accordance with the Scriptural method of adding force to an
affirmative by a negative, and vice versa, as in the words (Matthew
17:22): "Not until seven times, but until seventy times seven."

In summary,[^25] the *Teaching of the Twelve Apostles* shows throughout
that the most ancient doctrine of the church, after the apostles, was in
perfect harmony with universal salvation. Cyprian (250 AD), in a letter
to his son Magnus, tells us that in addition to the baptismal formula
converts were asked, "Do you believe in the remission of sins and
eternal life through the holy church?"

## The Apostles' Creed.[^26]

"The Apostles\' Creed," *so called*, the oldest existing authorized
declaration of Christian faith in the shape of a creed was probably in
existence in various modified forms for a century or so before the
beginning of the Fourth Century, when it took its present shape,
possibly between 250 and 350 AD. It is first found in Rufinus, who wrote
at the end of the Fourth and the beginning of the Fifth Century. No
allusion is made to it before these dates by Justin Martyr, Clement,
Origen, the historian Eusebius, or any of their contemporaries, all of
whom make declarations of Christian belief, nor is there any hint in
antecedent literature that any such document existed. Individual
declarations of faith were made, however, quite unlike the pseudo
Apostles\' Creed, by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Gregory
Thaumaturgus, etc.

Karl Hagenbach assures us that it was \"probably inspired of various
confessions of faith used by the primitive church in the baptismal
service."[^27]

Johann Lorenz von Mosheim declares: "All who have any knowledge of
antiquity confess unanimously that the opinion (that the apostles
composed the Apostles\' Creed) is a mistake and has no foundation."[^28]

The clauses "the Holy Catholic Church," "the communion of Saints," "the
forgiveness of sins," were added after 250 AD. "He descended into hell"
was later than the compilation of the original creed --- as late as 359
AD. The document is here given. The portion in regular type was probably
adopted in the earlier part or middle of the Second Century[^29] and was
in Greek; the italic portion was added later by the Roman Church, and
was in Latin:

"I believe in God the Father Almighty (*maker of heaven and earth*) and
in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord, who was (*conceived*) by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified (*dead*) and buried, (*He descended into hell*). The third day
he arose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven and sits at the
right hand of (*God*) the Father (*Almighty*). From thence he shall come
to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy
(*Catholic*) Church; (*the communion of saints*) the forgiveness of
sins; the resurrection of the body; (*and the life everlasting*[^30]).
Amen."

It will be seen that not a word is here uttered of the duration of
punishment. The later form speaks of "*aionian* life," but does not
refer to *aionian* death, or punishment. It is incredible that this
declaration of faith, made at a time when the world was ignorant of what
constituted the Christian belief, and which was made for the purpose of
informing the world, should not convey a hint of so vital a doctrine as
that of endless punishment, if at that time that dogma was a tenet of
the church.

## The Oldest Creedal Statement.

The oldest creedal statement by the Church of Rome says that Christ
"shall come to judge the quick and the dead," and announces belief in
the resurrection of the body. The oldest of the Greek constitutions
declares belief in the "resurrection of the flesh, remission of sins,
and the *aionian* life." And the Alexandrian statement speaks of "the
life," but there is not a word of everlasting death or punishment in any
of them. And this is all that the most ancient creeds contain on the
subject.[^31]

In a germinal form of the Apostles\' Creed, Irenaeus (180 AD) says that
the judge, at the final assize, will cast the wicked into *aionian*
fire. It is supposed that he used the word *aionian*, for the Greek in
which he wrote has perished, and the Latin translation reads, "*ignem
aeternum.*"

As Origen uses the same word, and expressly says it denotes limited
duration, Irenaeus\' testimony does not help the doctrine of endless
punishment, nor can it be quoted to reinforce that of universal
salvation. Dr. Beecher thinks that Irenaeus taught "a final restitution
of all things to unity and order by the annihilation of all the finally
impenitent"[^32] --- a pseudo-Universalism.[^33]

## Tertullian's Belief.

Even Tertullian, born about 160 AD, though his personal belief was
fearfully partialistic, could not assert that his pagan-born doctrine
was generally accepted by Christians, and when he formed a creed for
general acceptance he entirely omitted his lurid theology. It will be
seen that Tertullian\'s creed like that of Irenaeus is one of the
earlier forms of the so-called Apostles' Creed:[^34]

"We believe in one only God, omnipotent, maker of the world, and his son
Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate,
raised from the dead the third day, received into the heavens, now
sitting at the right hand of the Father, and who shall come to judge the
living and the dead, through the resurrection of the flesh."

Tertullian did not put his private belief into his creed, and at that
time he had not discovered that worst of dogmas relating to man, total
depravity. In fact, he states the opposite. He says: "There is a portion
of God in the soul. In the worst there is something good, and in the
best something bad."[^35] Neander says that Tertullian "held original
goodness to be indelible."[^36]

## The Nicene Creed.[^37]

The next oldest creed, the first declaration authorized by a consensus
of the whole church, was the Nicene Creed (325 AD); completed in 381 at
Constantinople. Its sole reference to the future world is in these
words: "I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the
world (*aeon*) to come."[^38] It does not contain a syllable referring
to endless punishment, though the doctrine was then professed by a
portion of the church, and was insisted upon by some, though it was not
generally enough held to be stated as the average belief. So dominant
was the influence of the Greek fathers, who had learned Christianity in
their native tongue, in the language in which it was announced, and so
little had Tertullian\'s cruel ideas prevailed, that it was not even
attempted to make the horrid sentiment a part of the creed of the
church. Moreover, Gregory Nazianzen presided over the council in
Constantinople, in which the Nicene creed was finally shaped--- the
Niceo-Constantinopolitan creed --- and as he was a Universalist, and as
the clause, "I believe in the life of the world to come," was added by
Gregory of Nyssa, an "unflinching advocate of extreme Universalism, and
the very flower of orthodoxy,"[^39] it must be apparent that the
consensus of Christian sentiment was not yet anti-Universalistic and
deepest melancholy.

## General Sentiment in the Fourth Century.

Thus, the general sentiment in the church from 325 to 381 AD demanded
that the life beyond the grave be stated, and as there is no hint of the
existence of a world of torment, how can the conclusion be escaped that
Christian faith did not then include the thought of endless woe? Would a
council, composed even in part of believers in endless torment, permit a
Universalist to preside, and another to shape its creed, and not even
attempt to give expression to that idea? Is not the Nicene Creed a
witness, in what it does not say, to the broader faith that must have
been the religion of the century that adopted it?

It is historical[^40] that the four great General Councils held in the
first four centuries---those at Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and
Chalcedon---gave expression to no condemnation of universal restoration,
though, as will be shown, the doctrine had been prevalent all along.

In the Nicene Creed adopted in 325 AD, by three hundred and twenty to
two hundred and eighteen bishops, the only reference to the future world
is where it is said that Christ "will come again to judge the living and
the dead." This is the original form, subsequently changed.

In 341 AD the assembled bishops at Antioch made a declaration of faith
in which these words occur: "The Lord Jesus Christ will come again with
glory and power to judge the living and the dead."

In 346 AD the bishops presented a declaration to the Emperor
Constans[^41] affirming that Jesus Christ "shall come at the
consummation of the ages, to judge the living and the dead, and render
to every one according to his works."

The synod at Rimini, 359 AD, affirmed that Christ "descended to the
lower parts of the earth, and disposed matters there, at the sight of
whom the door-keepers trembled --- and at the last day he will come in
his Father\'s glory to render to every one according to his deeds." This
declaration opens the gates of mercy by recognizing the proclamation of
the Gospel to the dead, and, as it was believed that when Christ
preached in Hades the doors were opened and all those in ward were
released, the words recited at Rimini that he "disposed matters there,"
are very significant.

The Nicene and Constantinopolitan creeds, printed in one, will exhibit
the nature of the changes made at Constantinople, and will show that the
"life to come" and not the post-mortem woe of sinners, was the chief
thought with the early Christians. (The Nicene is here printed in
regular type, and the Constantinopolitan in Italic.)

## The Niceo-Constantinopolitan Creed.

"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of (*heaven and
earth, and*) all things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the (*only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before
all worlds,*) only begotten, that is, of the substance of the Father;
God of God, Light of Light, very God of Very God, begotten not made;
being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made,
\[transposed to the beginning\] the things in heaven and things in
earth. Who for us men and for our salvation came down (*from heaven*)
and was incarnate (*of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary*) and made man
(*and was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate*), and suffered (*and
was buried*), and rose again the third day (*according to the
Scriptures*), who ascended into heaven (*and sits on the right hand of
the Father)* and cometh again (*in glory*) to judge quick and dead (*of
whose kingdom there shall be no end*). And in the Holy Ghost, (*the Lord
and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and
the Son, together is worshiped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets;
in one holy Catholic, Apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for
the remission of sins; and we look for the resurrection of the dead, and
the life of the world to come.*)"[^42]

This last clause was not in the original Nicene Creed but was added in
the Constantinopolitan. The literal rendering of the Greek is "the life
of the age about to come."[^43]

The first Christians, it will be seen, said in their creeds, "I believe
in the *aeonian* life;" later, they modified the phrase "*aeonian*
life," to "the life of the coming *aeon*," showing that the phrases are
equivalent. But not a word of endless punishment. "The life of the age
to come" was the first Christian creed, and later, Origen himself
declares his belief in *aeonian* punishment, and in *aeonian* life
beyond. How, then, could *aeonian* punishment have been regarded as
endless?

The differences of opinion that existed among the early Christians are
easily accounted for, when we remember that they had been Jews or
Heathens, who had brought from their previous religious associations all
sorts of ideas and were disposed to retain them and reconcile them with
their new religion. Faith in Christ, and the acceptance of his
teachings, could not at once eradicate the old opinions, which, in some
cases, remained long, and caused honest Christians to differ from each
other. As will be shown, while the *Sibylline Oracles* predisposed some
of the fathers to Universalism, Philo gave others a tendency to the
doctrine of annihilation, and *Enoch* to endless punishment.

## Statements of the Early Councils.

Thus, the creedal declarations of the Christian church for almost four
hundred years are entirely void of the lurid doctrine with which they
afterwards blazed for more than a thousand years. The early creeds
contain no hint of it, and no whisper of condemnation of the doctrine of
universal restoration as taught by Clement, Origen, the Gregories, Basil
the Great, and multitudes besides.

Discussions and declarations on the Trinity, and contests over
*homoousion* (consubstantial) and *homoiousion* (of like substance)
engrossed the energy of disputants, and filled libraries of volumes, but
the doctrine of the great fathers remained unchallenged. Neither the
Concilium Nicaeum (325 AD) nor the Concilium Constantinopolitanum (381
AD) nor the Concilium Chalcedonenese (451 AD) lisped a syllable of the
doctrine of man\'s final woe.

The reticence of all the ancient formularies of faith concerning endless
punishment at the same time that the great fathers were proclaiming
universal salvation, as appears later on in these pages, is strong
evidence that the former doctrine was not then accepted. It is apparent
that the early Christian church did not dogmatize on man\'s final
destiny. It was engrossed in getting established among men the great
truth of God\'s universal Fatherhood, as revealed in the incarnation,
"God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,"[^44] Some taught
endless punishment for a portion of mankind; others, the annihilation of
the wicked; others had no definite opinion on human destiny; but the
larger part, especially from Clement of Alexandria on for three hundred
years, taught universal salvation. It is unthinkable[^45] that endless
punishment was a doctrine of the early church, when it is seen that not
one of the early creeds embodied it."[^46]

# 2. Early Christianity a Cheerful Religion.

## Darkness at the Advent.

When our Lord announced his religion this world was in a condition of
unutterable corruption, wretchedness and gloom. Slavery, poverty, vice
that the pen is unwilling to name, almost universally prevailed, and
even religion partook of the general degradation.[^47] Decadence,
depopulation, insecurity of property, person and life, according to
Taine,[^48] were everywhere. Philosophy taught that it would be better
for man never to have been created.[^49] In the first century Rome held
supreme sway.[^50] Nations had been destroyed by scores, and the
civilized world had lost half of its population by the sword. In the
first century forty out of seventy years were years of famine,
accompanied by plague and pestilence. There was universal depression and
deepest melancholy. When men were thus overborne with the gloom and
horror of error and sin, into their night of darkness[^51] came the
religion of Christ. Its announcements were all of hope and cheer. Its
language was,

"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you
rest."[^52]

"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice."[^53]

"We rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."[^54]

Men were invited to accept the tidings of great joy. John the Baptist,
the herald of Jesus, was a recluse, mortifying body and spirit, but
Jesus said, "John came neither eating nor drinking, but the Son of Man
came eating and drinking."[^55] He forbade all anxiety and care among
his followers, and exhorted all to be as trustful as are the lilies of
the field and the fowls of the air.[^56]

Says Matthew Arnold, "Christ professed to bring in happiness. All the
words that belong to his mission. Gospel, kingdom of God, Savior, grace,
peace, living water, bread of life, are brimful of promise and
joy."[^57] And his cheerful, joyful religion at once won its way by its
messages of peace and tranquility, and for a while its converts were
everywhere characterized by their joyfulness and cheerfulness.

Hugh R. Haweis[^58] writes: "The three first centuries of the Christian
church are almost idyllic in their simplicity, sincerity and purity.
There is less admixture of evil, less intrusion of the world, the flesh,
and the devil, more simple-hearted goodness, earnestness and reality to
be found in the space between Nero and Constantine than in any other
three centuries from AD 100 to 1800."[^59]

Edmond de Pressensé calls the early era of the church its "blessed
childhood, all calmness and simplicity."[^60]

William Cave states: "The noblest portion of church history...the most
considerable age of the church, the years from Eusebius to Basil the
Great."[^61]

## "Sweetness and Light"

Christianity was everywhere at first, a religion of "sweetness and
light."[^62] The Greek fathers exemplified all these qualities, and
Clement and Origen were ideals of its perfect spirit. But from Augustine
downward the Latin reaction, prompted by the tendency of men in all ages
to escape the exactions laid upon the soul by thought, and who flee to
external authority to avoid the demands of reason, was away from the
genius of Christianity, until Augustinianism ripened into Popery, and
the beautiful system of the Greek fathers was succeeded by the nightmare
of the theology of the mediaeval centuries, and later of Calvinism and
Puritanism.[^63]

Had the church followed the prevailing spirit of the ante-Nicene Fathers
it would have conserved the best thought of Greece, the divine ideals of
Plato, and joined them to the true interpretation of Christianity, and
we may venture to declare that it would thus have continued the career
of progress that had rendered the first three centuries so marvelous in
their character; a progress that would have continued with accelerated
speed, and Christendom would have widened its borders and deepened its
sway immeasurably. With the prevalence of the Latin language the East
and the West grew apart, and the latter, more and more discarding
reason, and controlled, by the iron inflexibility of a semi-pagan
secular government, gave Roman Catholicism its opportunity.

## Oriental Asceticism.

The influence of the ascetic religions of the Asiatic countries,
especially Buddhism, contaminated Christianity, resulting later in
celibacy, monasteries, convents, hermits, and all the worse elements of
Catholicism in the Middle Ages.[^64] At the first contact Christianity
absorbed more than it modified, till in the later ages the alien force
became supreme. In fact, orientalism was already beginning to mar the
beautiful simplicity of Christianity when John wrote his Gospel to
counteract it. Philip Schaff remarks:

"All the germs of (Christian) asceticism appear in the third century....
The first two Christian hermits were not till Paul of Thebes, AD 250,
and Anthony of Egypt, AD 270, appeared. Asceticism was in existence long
before Christ. Jews, Nazarites, Essenes, Therapeutae, Persians, Indians,
Buddhists, all originated this Oriental heathenism.... The religion of
the Chinese, Buddhism, Brahmanism, the religion of Zoroaster and of the
Egyptians, more or less leavened Christianity in its earliest stages. So
did Greek and Roman paganism with which the apostles and their followers
came into direct contact."[^65]

The doctrines of substitutional atonement, resurrection of the body,
native depravity, and endless punishment, are not lisped in the earliest
creeds or formulas.[^66] The earliest Christians[^67] taught that man is
the image of God, and that the indwelling Deity will lead him to
holiness. In Alexandria, the center of Greek culture and Christian
thought, \"more thoroughly Greek than Athens in its days of renown,\"
the theological atmosphere was more nearly akin to that of the
Universalist church of the present day than to that of any other branch
of the Christian church during the last fifteen centuries.[^68]

## Wonderful Progress of Christianity at First.

The wonderful progress made during the first three centuries by the
simple, pure and cheerful faith of early Christianity shows us what its
growth might have been made had not the morose spirit of Tertullian,
reinforced by the "dark shadow of Augustine,"[^69] transformed it. As
early as the beginning of the second century the heathen Pliny, the
propraetor of Bithynia, reported to the emperor that his province was so
filled with Christians that the worship of the heathen deities had
nearly ceased. And they were not only of the poor and despised, but of
all conditions of life --- *omnis ordinis*.

Joseph Milner[^70] thinks that Asia Minor was at this time quite
thoroughly evangelized. As early as the close of the Second Century
there were not only many converts from the humbler ranks, but "the main
strength of Christianity lay in the middle, perhaps in the mercantile
classes."[^71]

Gibbon says the Christians were not one-twentieth part of the Roman
Empire, till Constantine gave them the sanction of his authority, but
Robertson estimates them at one-fifth of the whole, and in some
districts as the majority.[^72]

Origen in *Against Celsus* says: "At the present day (240 AD) not only
rich men, but persons of rank, and delicate and high-born ladies,
receive the teachers of Christianity; and the religion of Christ is
better known than the teachings of the best philosophers."

And Arnobius testifies that Christians included orators, grammarians,
rhetoricians, lawyers, physicians, and philosophers. It was precisely
their bright and cheerful views of life and death, of God\'s universal
fatherhood and man\'s universal brotherhood --- the divinity of its
ethical principles and the purity of its professors, that account for
the wonderful progress of Christianity during the three centuries that
followed our Lord\'s death. The pessimism of the oriental religions; the
corruption and folly of the Greek and Roman mythology; the unutterable
wickedness of the mass of mankind, and the universal depression of
society invited its advance, and gave way before it.

Justin Martyr wrote that in his time prayers and thanksgivings were
offered in "the name of the Crucified, among every race of men, Greek or
barbarian."[^73]

Tertullian states that all races and tribes, even to farthest Britain,
had heard the news of salvation. He declared: "We are but of yesterday,
and lo we fill the whole empire --- your cities, your islands, your
fortresses, your municipalities, your councils, nay even the camp, the
tribune, the decory, the palace, the senate, the forum."[^74]

Chrysostom testifies that "the isles of Britain in the heart of the
ocean had been converted."[^75]

## God's Fatherhood.

The talismanic word of the Alexandrian fathers, as of the New Testament,
was father. This word, as now, unlocked all mysteries, God\'s solved all
problems, and all the enigmas of time and eternity. Holding God as
Father, punishment was held to be remedial, and therefore restorative,
and final recovery from sin universal. It was only when the Father was
lost sight of in the judge and tyrant, under the baneful reign of
Augustinianism, that Deity was hated, and that Catholics transferred to
Mary, and later, Protestants gave to Jesus that supreme love that is due
alone to the Universal Father.[^76] For centuries in Christendom after
the Alexandrine form of Christianity had waned, the Fatherhood of God
was a lost truth, and most of the worst errors of the modern creeds are
due to that single fact, more than to all other causes.

It was during those happy years more than in any subsequent three
centuries, that, as Jerome observed, "the blood of Christ was yet warm
in the breasts of Christians."[^77]

Says the accurate historian, Cave, in his *Primitive Christianity*:
"Here he will find a piety active and zealous, shining through the
blackest clouds of malice and cruelty; afflicted innocence triumphant,
notwithstanding all the powerful or politic attempts of men or devils; a
patience unconquerable under the biggest temptations; a charity truly
catholic and unlimited; a simplicity and upright carriage in all
transactions; a sobriety and temperance remarkable to the admiration of
their enemies; and, in short, he will see the divine and holy precepts
of the Christian religion drawn down into action, and the most excellent
genius and spirit of the Gospel breathing in the hearts and lives of
these good old Christians."

## Christianity a Greek Religion.

"Christianity,\" says Milman, "was almost from the first a Greek
religion. Its primal records were all written in the Greek language; it
was promulgated with the greatest rapidity and success among nations
either of Greek descent, or those which had been Grecized by the
conquest of Alexander. In their polity the Grecian churches were a
federation of republics."[^78] At the first, art, literature, life, were
Greek, cheerful, sunny, serene. The Latin type of character was morose,
gloomy, characterized, says Milman, by "adherence to legal form; severe
subordination to authority. The Roman Empire extended over Europe by a
universal code, and by subordination to a spiritual Caesar as absolute
as he was in civil obedience. Thus the original simplicity of the
Christian polity was entirely subverted; its pure democracy became a
spiritual autocracy. The presbyters developed into bishops, the bishop
of Rome became pope, and Christendom reflected Rome."[^79] But during
the first three centuries this change had not taken place. "It is there,
therefore, among the Alexandrine fathers that we are to look to find
Christianity in its pristine purity. The language, organization,
writers, and Scriptures of the church in the first centuries were all
Greek. The Gospels were everywhere read in Greek, the commercial and
literary language of the empire. The books were in Greek, and even in
Gaul and Rome Greek was the liturgical language. *The Octavius* of
Minucius Felix, and Novation on the Trinity, were the earliest known
works of Latin Christian literature."[^80]

## An Impressive Thought. 

The Greek Fathers derived their Universalism directly and solely from
the Greek Scriptures. Nothing to suggest the doctrine existed in Greek
or Latin literature, mythology, or theology; all current thought on
matters of eschatology was utterly opposed to any such view of human
destiny. And, furthermore, the unutterable wickedness, degradation and
woe that filled the world would have inclined the early Christians to
the most pessimistic view of the future consistent with the teachings of
the religion they had espoused. To know that, in those dreadful times,
they derived the divine optimism of universal deliverance from sin and
sorrow from the teachings of Christ and his apostles, should predispose
every modern to agree with them. On this point Allin, in *Universalism
Asserted*, eloquently says:

"The church was born into a world of whose moral rottenness few have or
can have any idea. Even the sober historians of the later Roman Empire
have their pages tainted with scenes impossible to translate. Lusts the
foulest, debauchery to us happily inconceivable, raged on every side. To
assert even faintly the final redemption of all this rottenness, whose
depths we dare not try to sound, required the firmest faith in the
larger hope, as an essential part of the Gospel. But this is not all; in
a peculiar sense the church was militant in the early centuries. It was
engaged in, at times, a struggle, for life or death, with a relentless
persecution. Thus it must have seemed in that age almost an act of
treason to the cross to teach that, though dying unrepentant, the bitter
persecutor, or the votary of abominable lusts, should yet in the ages to
come find salvation. Such considerations help us to see the extreme
weight attaching even to the very least expression in the fathers which
involves sympathy with the larger hope...especially so when we consider
that the idea of mercy was then but little known, and that truth, as we
conceive it, was not then esteemed a duty. As the vices of the early
centuries were great, so were their punishments cruel. The early fathers
wrote when the wild beasts of the arena tore alike the innocent and the
guilty, limb from limb, amid the applause even of gently-nurtured women;
they wrote when the cross, with its living burden of agony, was a common
sight, and evoked no protest. They wrote when every minister of justice
was a torturer, and almost every criminal court a petty inquisition;
when every household of the better class, even among Christians, swarmed
with slaves liable to torture, to scourging, to mutilation, at the
caprice of a master or the frown of a mistress. Let all these facts be
fully weighed, and a conviction arises irresistibly, that, in such an
age, no idea of Universalism could have originated unless inspired from
above. If, now, when criminals are shielded from suffering with almost
morbid care, men, the best of men, think with very little concern of the
unutterable woe of the lost, how, I ask, could Universalism have arisen
of itself in an age like that of the fathers? Consider further. The
larger hope is not, we are informed, in the Bible; it is not, we know,
in the heart of man naturally; still less was it there in days such as
those we have described, when mercy was unknown, when the dearest
interest of the church forbade its avowal. But it is found in many, very
many, ancient fathers, and often, in the very broadest form, embracing
every fallen spirit. Where, then, did they find it? Whence did they
import this idea? Can we doubt that the fathers could only have drawn
it, as their writings testify, from the Bible itself?"[^81]

## Testimony of the Catacombs. 

An illuminating sidelight is cast on the opinions of the early
Christians by the inscriptions and emblems on the monuments in the Roman
Catacombs.[^82] It is well known that from the end of the First to the
end of the Fourth Century the early Christians buried their dead,
probably with the knowledge and consent of the pagan authorities, in
subterranean galleries excavated in the soft rock (*tufa*) that
underlies Rome. These ancient cemeteries were first uncovered in 1578
AD. Already sixty excavations have been made extending five hundred and
eighty-seven miles. More than six, some estimates say eight, million
bodies are known to have been buried between 72 and 410 AD. Eleven
thousand epitaphs and inscriptions have been found; few dates are
between 72 and 100 AD; the most are from 150 to 410 AD. The galleries
are from three to five feet wide and eight feet high, and the niches for
bodies are five tiers deep, one above another, each silent tenant in its
separate cell. At the entrance of each cell is a tile or slab of marble,
once securely cemented and inscribed with name, epitaph or emblem.[^83]
Haweis beautifully says in his *Conquering Cross*: \"The public life of
the early Christian was persecution above ground; his private life was
prayer underground.\" The emblems and inscriptions are most suggestive.
The principal device, scratched on slabs, carved on utensils and rings,
and seen almost everywhere, is the Good Shepherd, surrounded by his
flock and carrying a lamb. But most striking of all, he is found with a
goat on his shoulder; which teaches us that even the wicked were at that
early date regarded as the objects of the Savior\'s solicitude, after
departing from this life.[^84]

Matthew Arnold has preserved this truth in his immortal verse:[^85]

*\"He saves the sheep, the goats he doth not save!\"*

> *So rang Tertullian\'s sentence on the side*
>
> *Of that unpitying Phrygian sect which cried,---*

*\"Him can no fount of fresh forgiveness lave,*

*Whose sins once washed by the baptismal wave!\"*

> *So spake the fierce Tertullian. But she sighed,*
>
> *The infant Church, --- of love she felt the tide*

*Stream on her from her Lord\'s yet recent grave.*

> *And then she smiled, and in the Catacombs,*

*With eyes suffused but heart inspired true.*

> *On those walls subterranean, where she hid*

*Her head in ignominy, death and tombs.*

> *She her Good Shepherd\'s hasty image drew*
>
> *And on his shoulders not a lamb, a kid!*

The picture is a \"distinct protest\" against the unchristian sentiment
then already creeping into the church from Paganism.

## Early Funeral Emblems.

Everywhere in the Catacombs is the anchor, emblem of that hope which
separated Christianity from Paganism. Another symbol is the fish, which
plays a prominent part in Christian symbolism. It is curious and
instructive to account for this ideograph. It is used as a cryptogram of
Christ. The word is a sort of acrostic of the name and office of our
Lord.

The Greek word fish, in capitals --- *IXOYE* --- would be a secret
cypher that would stand for our Lord\'s name, when men dared not write
or speak it; and the word or the picture of a fish meant to the
Christian the name of his Savior; and he wore as a charm a fish cut in
ivory, or mother-of-pearl, on his neck living, and bore to his grave to
be exhumed centuries after his death an effigy of a fish to signify his
faith. These and the vine, the sheep, the dove, the ark, the palm and
other emblems in the Catacombs express only hope, faith, cheerful
confidence. The horrid inventions of Augustine, the cruel monstrosities
of Michelangelo[^86] and Dante, and the abominations of the mediaeval
theology were all unthought of then, and have no hint in the Catacombs.

Still more instructive are the inscriptions. As De Rossi observes, the
most ancient inscriptions differ from those of the Pagans "more by what
they do not say than by what they do say." [^87] While the Pagans denote
the rank or social position of their dead as *clarissima femine*, or
lady of senatorial rank, Christian epigraphy is destitute of all mention
of distinctions. Only the name and some expression of endearment and
confidence are inscribed.

Says Northcote: "They proceed upon the assumption that there is an
incessant interchange of kindly offices between this world and the next,
between the living and the dead."[^88] Mankind is a brotherhood, and not
a word can be found to show any thought of the mutilation of the great
fraternity, and the consignment of any portion of it to final despair.
Such are these among the inscriptions:

"Peace with you, Urania;"[^89]

"Always in God may you live, sweet soul;"[^90]

"May you live in the Lord, and pray for us."

They had "emigrated," had been "translated," "born into eternity," but
not a word is found expressive of doubt or fear, horror and gloom, such
as in subsequent generations formed the staple of the literature of
death and the grave, and rendered the Christian graveyard, up to the
beginning of the seventeenth century, a horrible place. The first
Christians regarded the grave as the doorway into a better world and
expressed only hope and trust in their emblems and inscriptions.

Following are additional specimen epitaphs:

"Irene in Pace."

"Here lies Marcia put to rest in a dream of peace."

"Victoria sleeps;"[^91]

"Zoticus laid here to sleep;"[^92]

"Snatched home eternally."[^93]

"In Christ; Alexander is not dead but lives beyond the stars, and his
body rests in this tomb."

Contrast these with the tone of heathen funeral inscriptions. In general
the pagan epitaphs were like that which Sophocles expresses in the
*Oedipis*, at Colomus:

> "Happiest beyond compare\
> Never to taste of life;\
> Happiest in order next.\
> Being born, with quickest speed\
> Thither again to turn.\
> From whence we came."

"In a Roman monument which I had occasion to publish not long since, a
father (Caius Sextus by name,) is represented bidding farewell to his
daughter, and two words --- \'*Vale Aeternam*,\' farewell forever ---
give an expressive utterance to the feeling of blank and hopeless
severance with which Greeks and Romans were burdened when the reality of
death was before their eyes."[^94] Death was a cheerful event in the
eyes of the early Christians. It was called birth. Anchors, harps,
palms, crowns, surrounded the grave. They discarded lamentations and
extravagant grief. The prayers for the dead were thanksgiving for God\'s
goodness.[^95] Their language is such as could not have been used by
them had they entertained the views that prevailed from the Sixth to the
Eighteenth Century, among the majority of Christians; and their remains
all testify to the cheerfulness of early Christianity.

## Cheerful Faith of the First Christians.

"The fathers of the church live in their voluminous works; the lower
orders are only represented by these simple records, from which, with
scarcely an exception, sorrow and complaint are banished; the boast of
suffering, or an appeal to the revengeful passions is nowhere to be
found. One expresses faith, another hope, a third charity. The genius of
primitive Christianity --- to believe, to love and to suffer --- has
never been better illustrated. These \'sermons in stones\' are addressed
to the heart and not to the head --- to the feelings rather than to the
taste.... In all the pictures and scriptures of our Lord\'s history no
reference is ever found to his sufferings or death. No gloomy subjects
occur in the cycle of Christian art."[^96]

Chrysostom says: "For this cause, too, the place itself is called a
cemetery; that you may know that the dead laid there are not dead, but
at rest and asleep. For before the coming of Christ death used to be
called death, and not only so, but Hades, but after his coming and dying
for the life of the world, death came to be called death no longer, but
sleep and repose.\"[^97] The word cemeteries, dormitories, shows us that
death was regarded as a state of repose and thus a condition of hope. In
fact, \"in this auspicious word," now for the first time applied to the
tomb, there is manifest a sense of hope and immortality, the result of a
new religion. A star had arisen on the borders of the grave, dispelling
the horror of darkness which had hitherto reigned there; the prospect
beyond was now cleared up, and so dazzling was the view of an \'eternal
city sculptured in the sky, that numbers were found eager to rush
through the gate of martyrdom, for the hope of entering its starry
portals."[^98]

Says Ruskin: "Not a cross as a symbol in the Catacombs. The earliest
certain Latin cross is on the tomb of the Empress Galla Placidia, 451
AD. No picture of the crucifixion till the Ninth Century, nor any
portable crucifix till long after. To the early Christians Christ was
living, the one agonized hour was lost in the thought of his glory and
triumph. The fall of theology and Christian thought dates from the error
of dwelling upon his death instead of his life."[^99]

Farrar adds: "The symbols of the Catacombs, like every other indication
of early teaching, show the glad, bright, loving character of the
Christian faith. It was a religion of joy and not of gloom, of life and
not of death, of tenderness not of severity.... We see in them as in the
acts of the apostles, that the keynotes of the music of the Christian
life were \'exultation\' and \'simplicity.\' And how far superior in
beauty and significance were these early Christian symbols to the
meaningless and pagan broken columns and broken rosebuds and skulls and
weeping women and inverted torches of our cemeteries. We find in the
Catacombs neither the cross of the fifth and sixth centuries, nor the
crucifixes of the twelfth, nor the torches and martyrdoms of the
seventeenth, nor the skeletons of the fifteenth, nor the cypresses and
death\'s heads of the eighteenth. Instead of these the symbols of
beauty, hope and peace."[^100]

## Dean Stanley's Testimony.

From 70 AD, the date of the fall of Jerusalem, to about 150 AD, there is
very little Christian literature. It is only with Justin Martyr, who was
executed in 166 AD, that there is any considerable literature of the
church. The fathers before Justin are "shadows, formless phantoms, whose
writings are uncertain and only partly genuine."

Speaking of the scarcity of literature pertaining to those times and the
changes experienced by Christianity, says Dean Stanley: \"No other
change equally momentous has ever since affected its features, yet none
has ever been so silent and secret. The stream in that most critical
moment of its passage from the everlasting hills to the plain below is
lost to our view at the very point where we are most anxious to watch
it. We may hear its struggles under the overarching rocks; we may catch
its spray on the boughs that overlap its course, but the torrent itself
we see not or see only by imperfect glimpses.... A fragment here, an
allegory there; romances of unknown authorship; a handful of letters of
which the genuineness of every portion is contested inch by inch; the
summary explanation of a Roman magistrate; the pleadings of two or three
Christian apologists; customs and opinions in the very act of change;
last, but not least, the faded paintings, the broken sculptures, the
rude epitaphs in the darkness of the Catacombs --- these are the scanty,
though attractive materials out of which the likeness of the early
church must be produced, as it was working its way, in the literal sense
of the word, underground, under camp and palace, under senate and
forum."[^101]

There were eighty years between Paul\'s last epistle and the first of
the writings of the Christian fathers. Besides the writings of Tacitus
and Pliny, the long hiatus is filled only by the emblems and
inscriptions of the Catacombs. What an eloquent story they tell of the
cheerfulness of primitive Christianity![^102]

# 3. Origin of Endless Punishment. 

When our Lord spoke, the doctrine of unending torment was believed by
many of those who listened to his words, and they stated it in terms and
employed others, entirely different, in describing the duration of
punishment, from the terms afterward used by those who taught universal
salvation and annihilation, and so gave to the terms in question the
sense of unlimited duration.

For example, the Pharisees, according to Josephus, regarded the penalty
of sin as torment without end, and they stated the doctrine in
unambiguous terms. They called it *eirgmos aidios* (eternal
imprisonment) and *timorion adialeipton* (endless torment), while our
Lord called the punishment of sin *aionion kolasin* (age-long
chastisement).

## Meaning of Scriptural Terms. 

The language of Josephus is used by the profane Greeks but is never
found in the New Testament connected with punishment. Josephus, writing
in Greek to Jews, frequently employs the word that our Lord used to
define the duration of punishment (*aionios*), but he applies it to
things that had ended or that will end.[^103] Can it be doubted that our
Lord placed his ban on the doctrine that the Jews had derived from the
heathen by never using their terms describing it, and that he taught a
limited punishment by employing words to define it that only meant
limited duration in contemporaneous literature? Josephus used the word
*aionios* with its current meaning of limited duration. He applies it to
the imprisonment of John the Tyrant; to Herod\'s reputation; to the
glory acquired by soldiers; to the fame of an army as a \"happy life and
*aionian* glory.\" He used the words as do the Scriptures to denote
limited duration, but when he would describe endless duration he uses
different terms. Of the doctrine of the Pharisees he says:

\"They believe...that wicked spirits are to be kept in an eternal
imprisonment (*eirgmon aidion*). The Pharisees say all souls are
incorruptible, but while those of good men are removed into other bodies
those of bad men are subject to eternal punishment\" (*aidios timoria*).
Elsewhere he says that the Essenes, \"allot to bad souls a dark,
tempestuous place, full of never-ceasing torment (*timoria
adialeipton*), where they suffer a deathless torment\" (*athanaton
timorion*). *Aidion* and *Athanaton* are his favorite terms for
duration, and *timoria* (torment) for punishment.

## Philo's Use of the Words.

Philo, who was contemporary with Christ, generally used *aidion* to
denote endless, and *aionion* temporary duration. He uses the exact
phraseology of Matthew 25:46, precisely as Christ used it: \"It is
better not to promise than not to give prompt assistance, for no blame
follows in the former case, but in the latter there is dissatisfaction
from the weaker class, and a deep hatred and *aeonian* punishment
(chastisement) from such as are more powerful.\" Here we have the
precise terms employed by our Lord, which show that *aionion* did not
mean endless but did mean limited duration in the time of Christ. Philo
adopts *athanaton*, *ateleuteton* or *aidion* to denote endless, and
*aionion* temporary duration. In one place occurs this sentence
concerning the wicked: \"to live always dying, and to undergo, as it
were, an immortal and interminable death.\"[^104] Stephens, in his
valuable \"Thesaurus,\" quotes from a Jewish work: \"These they called
*aionios*, hearing that they had performed the sacred rites for three
entire generations.\"[^105] This shows conclusively that the expression
\"three generations\" was then one full equivalent of *aionion*. Now,
these eminent scholars were Jews who wrote in Greek, and who certainly
knew the meaning of the words they employed, and they give to the
*aeonian* words the sense of indefinite duration, to be determined in
any case by the scope of the subject. Had our Lord intended to inculcate
the doctrine of the Pharisees, he would have used the terms by which
they described it. But his word defining the duration of punishment was
*aionion*, while their words are *aidion*, *adialeipton*, and
*athanaton.* Instead of saying with Philo and Josephus, *thanaton
athanaton*, deathless or immortal death; *eirgmon aidion*, eternal
imprisonment; *aidion timorion*, eternal torment; and *thanaton
ateleuteton*, interminable death, he used *aionion kolasin*, an
adjective in universal use for limited duration, and a noun denoting
suffering issuing in amendment. The word by which our Lord describes
punishment is the word *kolasin*, which is thus defined:

"Chastisement, punishment.\"

\"The trimming of the luxuriant branches of a tree or vine to improve it
and make it fruitful.\"

\"The act of clipping or pruning --- restriction, restraint, reproof,
check, chastisement.\"

\"The kind of punishment which tends to the improvement of the criminal
is what the Greek philosophers called *kolasis* or chastisement.\"

\"Pruning, checking, punishment, chastisement, correction.\"

\"Do we want to know what was uppermost in the minds of those who formed
the word for punishment? The Latin *poena* or *punio*, to punish, the
root *pu* in Sanskrit, which means to cleanse, to purify, tells us that
the Latin derivation was originally formed, not to express mere striking
or torture, but cleansing, correcting, delivering from the stain of
sin.\"[^106]

That it had this meaning in Greek usage, see Plato: \"For the natural or
accidental evils of others no one gets angry, or admonishes, or teaches,
or punishes (*kolazei*) them, but we pity those afflicted with such
misfortune...for if, O Socrates, if you will consider what is the design
of punishing (*kolazein*) the wicked, this of itself will show you that
men think virtue something that may be acquired; for no one punishes
(*kolazei*) the wicked, looking to the past only simply for the wrong he
has done --- that is, no one does this thing who does not act like a
wild beast; desiring only revenge, without thought. Hence, he who seeks
to punish (*kolazein*) with reason does not punish for the sake of the
past wrong deed...but for the sake of the future, that neither the man
himself who is punished may do wrong again, nor any other who has seen
him chastised. And he who entertains this thought must believe that
virtue may be taught, and he punishes (*kolazei*) for the purpose of
deterring from wickedness?\"[^107]

## Use of Gehenna.

So of the place of punishment (*Gehenna*) the Jews at the time of Christ
never understood it to denote endless punishment. The reader of
Farrar\'s *Mercy and Judgment*, *and Eternal Hope*, and Windet\'s *De
Vita functorum statu*, will find any number of statements from the
Talmudic and other Jewish authorities, affirming in the most explicit
language that *Gehenna* was understood by the people to whom our Lord
addressed the word as a place or condition of temporary duration. They
employed such terms as these:

\"The wicked shall be judged in *Gehenna* until the righteous say
concerning them, \'We have seen enough.\'\"[^108]

\"*Gehenna* is nothing but a day in which the impious will be burned.\"

\"After the last judgment *Gehenna* exists no longer.\"

"There will hereafter be no *Gehenna*.\"[^109]

These quotations might be multiplied indefinitely to demonstrate that
the Jews to whom our Lord spoke regarded *Gehenna* as of limited
duration, as did the Christian Fathers. Origen in his reply to Celsus
(VI, xxv) gives an exposition of *Gehenna,* explaining its usage in his
day. He says it is an analogue of the well-known valley of the Son of
Hinnom, and signifies the fire of purification. Now observe: Christ
carefully avoided the words in which his auditors expressed endless
punishment (*aidios, timoria* and *adialeiptos*), and used terms they
did not use with that meaning (*aionios kolasis*), and employed the term
which by universal consent among the Jews has no such meaning
(*Gehenna*); and as his immediate followers and the earliest of the
Fathers pursued exactly the same course, is it not demonstrated that
they intended to be understood as he was understood?[^110]

Professor Plumptre in a letter concerning Canon Farrar\'s sermons, says:
\"There were two words which the Evangelists might have used ---
*kolasis, timoria*. Of these, the first carries with it, by the
definition of the greatest of Greek ethical writers, the idea of a
reformatory process, (Aristotle, Rhet. I, X, 10-17). It is inflicted
\'for the sake of him who suffers it.\' The second, on the other hand,
describes a penalty purely vindictive or retributive. St. Matthew chose
--- if we believe that our Lord spoke Greek, he himself chose --- the
former word, and not the latter.\"

All the evidence conclusively shows that the terms defining punishment
--- \"everlasting,\" \"eternal,\" \"*Gehenna*,\" etc., in the Scriptures
teach its limited duration, and were so regarded by sacred and profane
authors, and that those outside of the Bible who taught unending torment
always employed other words than those used by our Lord and his
disciples.

Professor Allen concedes that the great prominence given to
\"hell-fire\" in Christian preaching is a modern innovation. He says:
\"There is more \'blood-theology\' and \'hell-fire,\' that is, the vivid
setting forth of everlasting torment to terrify the soul, in one sermon
of Jonathan Edwards, or one harangue at a modern \'revival,\' than can
be found in the whole body of homilies and epistles through all the dark
ages put together.... Set beside more modern dispensations the Catholic
position of this period (middle ages) is surprisingly merciful and
mild.\"[^111]

## Whence Came the Doctrine? 

## Of Heathen Origin.

When we ask the question: Where did those in the primitive Christian
church who taught endless punishment find it, if not in the Bible? ---
we are met by these facts: ---

1.  The New Testament was not in existence, as the canon had not been
    arranged.

2.  The Old Testament did not contain the doctrine.

3.  The Pagan and Jewish religions, the latter corrupted by heathen
    accretions, taught it.[^112]

Westcott tells us: \"The written Gospel of the first period of the
apostolic age was the Old Testament, interpreted by the vivid
recollection of the Savior\'s ministry.... The knowledge of the
teachings of Christ...to the close of the Second Century, were generally
derived from tradition, and not from writings. The Old Testament was
still the great store-house from which Christian teachers derived the
sources of consolation and conviction.\"[^113] Hence the false ideas
must have been brought by converts from Judaism or Paganism. The
immediate followers of our Lord\'s apostles do not explicitly treat
matters of eschatology. It was the age of apologetics and not of
polemics.[^114] The new revelation of the Divine Fatherhood through the
Son occupied the chief attention of Christians, and the efforts seem to
have been almost exclusively devoted to establish the truth of the
Incarnation, \"God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.\"[^115]
We may reasonably conclude that if this great truth had been kept
constantly in the foreground, uncorrupted by pagan error and human
invention, there would have been none of those false conceptions of God
that gave rise to the horrors of mediaeval times, --- and no occasion in
the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries for the renascence of original
Christianity in the form of Universalism. The first Christians, however,
naturally brought heathen increments into their new faith, so that very
early the doctrine of the annihilation of the wicked, or their endless
torment, began to be avowed. Here and there these doctrines appeared
from the very first, but the early writers generally either state the
great truths that legitimately result in universal good, or in
unmistakable terms avow the doctrine as a revealed truth of the
Christian Scriptures. \"Numbers flocked into the church who brought
their heathen ways with them.\"[^116]

At first Christianity was as a bit of leaven buried in foreign elements,
modifying and being modified. The early Christians had individual
opinions and idiosyncrasies, which at first their new faith did not
eradicate; they still retained some of their former errors. This
accounts for their different views of the future world. At the time of
our Lord\'s advent Judaism had been greatly corrupted. During the
captivity[^117] Chaldean, Persian and Egyptian doctrines, and other
oriental ideas had tinged the Mosaic religion, and in Alexandria,
especially, there was a great mixture of borrowed opinions and systems
of faith, it being supposed that no one form alone was complete and
sufficient, but that each system possessed a portion of the perfect
truth. \"The prevailing tone of mind was eclectic,\" and Christianity
did not escape the influence.

## The Apocryphal Book of Enoch.

More than a century before the birth of Christ[^118] appeared the
apocryphal *Book of Enoch*, which contains, so far as is known, the
earliest statement extant of the doctrine of endless punishment in any
work of Jewish origin. It became very popular during the early Christian
centuries, and modified, it may safely be supposed, the views of Tatian,
Minucius Felix, Tertullian, and their followers. It is referred to or
quoted from by Barnabas, Justin, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus,
Origen, Tertullian, Eusebius, Jerome, Hilary, Epiphanius, Augustine, and
others. Jude quotes from it in verses 14 and 15, and refers to it in
verse 6, on which account some of the fathers considered Jude
apocryphal; but it is probable that Jude quotes Enoch as Paul quotes the
heathen poets, not to endorse its doctrine, but to illustrate a point,
as writers nowadays quote fables and legends. Cave, in the *Lives of the
Fathers*, attributes the prevalence of the doctrine of fallen angels to
a perversion of the account (Gen. 6:1-4) of \"the sons of God and the
daughters of men.\" He refers the prevalence of the doctrine to \"the
authority of the \'Book of Enoch,\' (highly valued by many in those
days) wherein this story is related, as appears from the fragments of it
still extant.\" The entire work is now accessible through modern
discovery.

A little later than Enoch appeared the *Book of Ezra*, advocating the
same doctrine. These two books were popular among the Jews before the
time of Christ, and it is supposed, as the Old Testament is silent on
the subject, that the corrupt traditions of the Pharisees, of which our
Lord warned his disciples to beware,[^119] \"were obtained in part from
these books, or from the Egyptian and Pagan sources whence they were
derived. At any rate, though the Old Testament does not contain the
doctrine,[^120] Josephus, as has been seen, assures us that the
Pharisees of his time accepted and taught it. Of course they must have
obtained the doctrine from uninspired sources. As these and possibly
other similar books had already corrupted the faith of the Jews, they
seem later to have infused their virus into the faith of some of the
early Christians. Nothing is better established in history than that the
doctrine of endless punishment, as held by the Christian church in
mediaeval times, was of Egyptian origin,[^121] and that for purposes of
state it and its accessories were adopted by the Greeks and Romans.
Montesquieu states that "Romulus, Tatius and Numa enslaved the gods to
politics,\" and made religion for the state.

## Catholic Hell Copied from Heathen Sources.

Classic scholars know that the heathen hell was early copied by the
Catholic Church, and that almost its entire details afterwards entered
into the creeds of Catholic and Protestant churches up to a century ago.
Any reader may see this who will consult Pagan literature[^122] and
writers on the opinions of the ancients. And not only this, but the
heathen writers declare that the doctrine was invented to awe and
control the multitude.

Polybius writes: "Since the multitude is ever fickle...there is no other
way to keep them in order but by fear of the invisible world; on which
account our ancestors seem to me to have acted judiciously when they
contrived to bring into the popular belief these notions of the gods and
of the infernal regions.\"

Seneca says: \"Those things which make the infernal regions terrible,
the darkness, the prison, the river of flaming fire, the judgment seat,
etc., are all a fable.\"

Livy declares that Numa invented the doctrine, "a most efficacious means
of governing an ignorant and barbarous populace."

Strabo writes: "The multitude are restrained from vice by the
punishments the gods are said to inflict upon offenders...for it is
impossible to govern the crowd of women and all the common rabble by
philosophical reasoning: these things the legislators used as
scare-crows to terrify the childish multitude."

Similar language is found in Dionysius Halicarnassus, Plato, and other
writers. History records nothing more distinctly than that the Greek and
Roman Pagans borrowed of the Egyptians, and that some of the early
Christians unconsciously absorbed, or studiously appropriated, the
doctrines of the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans concerning post-mortem
punishment, and gradually corrupted the "simplicity that is in
Christ"[^123] by the inventions of antiquity, as from the same sources
the Jews at the time of Christ had already corrupted their
religion.[^124] What more natural than that the small reservoir of
Christian truth should be contaminated by the opinions that converts
from all these sources brought with them into their new religion at
first, and later that the Roman Catholic priests and Pagan legislators
should seize them as engines of power by which to control the world?

Coquerel describes the effect of the irruption of Pagans into the early
Christian church: \"The, at first, gradual entrance and soon rapid
irruption of an idolatrous multitude into the bosom of Christianity was
not effected without detriment to the truth. The Christianity of Jesus
was too lofty, too pure, for this multitude escaped from the degrading
cults of Olympus. The Pagans were not able to enter *en masse* into the
church without bringing to it their habits, their tastes, and some of
their ideas.\"[^125]

Milman and Neander think[^126] that old Jewish prejudices could not be
extirpated in the proselytes of the infant church, and that latent
Judaism lurked in it and was continued into the darker ages.

Chrysostom complains that the Christians of his time (the Fourth
Century) were \"half Jews.\"

Enfield[^127] declares that converts from the schools of Pagan
philosophy interwove their old errors with the simple truths of
Christianity until "heathen and Christian doctrines were still more
intimately blended...and both were almost entirely lost in the thick
clouds of ignorance and barbarism which covered the earth.... The
fathers of the church departed from the simplicity of the apostolic
church and corrupted the purity of the Christian faith.\"

Hagenbach reminds us that[^128] \"There were two errors which the
newborn Christianity had to guard against if it was not to lose its
peculiar religious features and disappear in one of the already existing
religions: against a relapse into Judaism on the one side, and against a
mixture with Paganism and speculations borrowed from it, and a
mythologizing tendency on the other.\"

*The Sibylline Oracles*, advocating universal restoration; Philo, who
taught annihilation, and *Enoch* and *Ezra*, who taught endless
punishment, were all read by the early Christians, and no doubt exerted
an influence in forming early opinions.

## Early Christianity Adulterated.

The Edinburgh Review concedes that \"upon a full inspection it will be
seen that the corruption of Christianity was itself the effect of that
vitiated state of the human mind, of which the vices of the government
were the great and primary cause.\" \"That the Christian religion
suffered much from the influence of the Gentile philosophy is
unquestionable.\"[^129]

Dr. Middleton, in a famous \"Letter from Rome,\" shows that from the
pantheon down heathen temples, shrines and altars were taken by the
early church, and so used that Pagans could employ them as well as
Christians and retain their old superstitions and errors while
professing Christianity. In other words, that much of Paganism, after
the First Century or two, remained in and corrupted Christianity.

Mosheim writes that \"no one objected (in the Fifth Century) to
Christians retaining the opinions of their Pagan ancestors;\" and Tytler
describes the confusion that resulted from the mixture of Pagan
philosophy with the plain and simple doctrines of the Christian
religion, from which the church in its infant state \"suffered in a most
essential manner.\"

T. B. Thayer,[^130] thinks that the faith of the early Christian church
"of the orthodox party was one-half Christian, one-quarter Jewish, and
one-quarter Pagan; while that of the gnostic party was about one-quarter
Christian and three-quarters philosophical Paganism.\" The purpose of
many of the fathers seems to have been to bridge the abyss between
Paganism and Christianity, and, for the sake of proselytes, to tolerate
Pagan doctrine.

Says Merivale: In the Fifth Century, \"Paganism was assimilated, not
extirpated, and Christendom has suffered from it more or less ever
since....The church...was content to make terms with what survived of
Paganism, content to lose even more than it gained in an unholy alliance
with superstition and idolatry; enticing, no doubt, many of the vulgar,
and some even of the more intelligent, to a nominal acceptance of the
Christian faith, but conniving at the surrender by the great mass of its
own baptized members of the highest and purest of their spiritual
acquisitions.\"[^131]

It is difficult to learn just how much surrounding influences affected
ancient or modem Christians, for, as Schaff says:[^132] \"The
theological views of the Greek Fathers were modified to a considerable
extent by Platonism; those of the mediaeval schoolmen, by the logic and
dialectics of Aristotle; those of the later times by the system of
Descartes, Spinoza, Bacon, Locke, Leibnitz, Kant, Fries, Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel. Few scientific divines can absolutely emancipate
themselves from the influence of the philosophy and public opinion of
their age, and when they do they have commonly their own philosophy,
etc.\"

## Original Greek New Testament.

That the Old Testament does not teach even post-mortem punishment is
universally conceded by scholars, as has been seen; and that the
Egyptians, and Greek and Roman Pagans did, is shown already. That the
doctrine was early in the Christian church, is equally evident. As the
early Christians did not obtain it from the Old Testament, which does
not contain it, and as it was already a Pagan doctrine, where could they
have procured it except from heathen sources? And as Universalism was
nowhere taught, and as the first Universalist Christians after the
apostles were Greeks, perfectly familiar with the language of the New
Testament, where else could they have found their faith than where they
declare they found it, in the New Testament? How can it be supposed that
the Latins were correct in claiming that the Greek Scriptures teach a
doctrine that the Greeks themselves did not find therein? And how can
the Greek fathers in the primitive church mistake when they understand
our Lord and his apostles to teach universal restoration?

\"It may be well to note here, that after the third century the descent
of the church into errors of doctrine and practice grew more rapid. The
worship of Jesus, of Mary, of saints, of relics, etc., followed each
other, Mary was called \'the Mother of God,\' \'the Queen of Heaven.\'
As God began to be represented more stern, implacable, cruel, the people
worshiped Jesus to induce him to placate his Father\'s wrath; and then
as the Son was held up as the severe judge of sinners and the
executioner of the Father\'s vengeance, men prayed Mary to mollify the
anger of her God-child; and when she became unfeeling or lacked
influence, they turned to Joseph and other saints, and to martyrs, to
intercede with their cold, implacable superiors. Thus theology became
more hard and merciless --- hell was intensified, and enlarged, and
eternized --- heaven shrunk, and receded, and lost its compassion ---
woman (despite the deification of Mary) was regarded as weak and
despicable --- the *Agapae*[^133] were abolished and the Eucharist
deified, and its cup withheld from the people --- and woman deemed too
impure to touch it! As among the heathen Romans, faith and reverence
decreased as their gods were multiplied, so here, as objects of worship
were increased, familiarity bred only sensuality, and sensuous worship
drove out virtue and veneration, until, in the language of Mrs.
Jameson\'s *Legends of the Madonna*,[^134] One of the frescoes in the
Vatican represents Giulia Farnese (a noted impure woman and mistress of
the pope!) in the character of the Madonna, and Pope Alexander VI (the
drunken, unchaste, beastly!) kneeling at her feet in the character of a
votary! Under the influence of the Medici, the churches of Florence were
filled with pictures of the Virgin in which the only thing aimed at was
a meretricious beauty. Savonarola thundered from his pulpit in the
garden of S. Marco against these impieties.\"[^135]

# 4. Doctrines of "Mitigation" and of "Reserve." 

There was no controversy among Christians over the duration of the
punishment of the wicked for at least three hundred years after the
death of Christ. Scriptural terms were used with their Scriptural
meanings, and while it is not probable that universal restoration was
polemically or dogmatically announced, it is equally probable that the
endless duration of punishment was not taught until heathen corruptions
had adulterated Christian truth. God\'s fatherhood and boundless love,
and the work of Christ in man\'s behalf were dwelt upon, accompanied by
the announcement of the fearful consequences of sin; but when those
consequences, through Pagan influences, came to be regarded as endless
in duration, then the antidotal truth of universal salvation assumed
prominence through Clement, Origen, and other Alexandrine fathers. Even
when some of the early Christians had so far been overcome by heathen
error as to accept the dogma of endless torment for the wicked, they had
no hard words for those who believed in universal restoration and did
not even controvert their views. The doctrines of Prayer for the Dead,
and of Christ Preaching to those in Hades, and of Mitigation, were
humane teachings of the primitive Christians that were subsequently
discarded.

## Mitigation Explained.

The doctrine of Mitigation was, that for some good deed on earth, the
damned in hell would occasionally be let out on a respite or
\"Mitigation\" furlough and have surcease of torment. This doctrine of
mitigation was quite general among the fathers when they came to
advocate the Pagan dogma. In fact, endless punishment in all its
enormity, destitute of all benevolent features, was not fully developed
until Protestantism was born, and prayers for the dead, mitigation of
the condition of the \"lost,\" and other softening features were
repudiated.[^136]

It was taught that the worst sinners --- Judas himself, even --- had
furloughs from hell for good deeds done on earth. Matthew Arnold
embodies one of the legends in his poem of St. Brandon. The saint once
met, on an iceberg on the ocean, the soul of Judas Iscariot, released
from hell for awhile, who explains his respite. He had once given a
cloak to a leper in Joppa, and so he says ---

> \"Once every year, when carols wake\
> On earth the Christmas night\'s repose,
>
> Arising from the sinner\'s lake\
> I journey to these healing snows.
>
> \"I stanch with ice my burning breast.\
> With silence calm my burning brain;
>
> O Brandon, to this hour of rest.\
> That Joppan leper\'s ease was pain.\"

It remained for Protestantism to discard all the softening features that
Catholicism had added to the bequest of heathenism to Christianity, and
to give the world the unmitigated horror that Protestantism taught from
the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century.

## The Doctrine of Reserve.

We cannot read the patristic literature understandingly unless we
constantly bear in mind the early fathers\' doctrine of \"Economy,\" or
\"Reserve.\"[^137] Plato distinctly taught it,[^138] and says that error
may be used as a medicine. He justifies the use of the "medicinal lie.\"
The resort of the early fathers to the esoteric is no doubt derived from
Plato. Origen almost quotes him when he says that sometimes fictitious
threats are necessary to secure obedience, as when Solon had purposely
given imperfect laws. Many, in and out of the church, held that the wise
possessor of truth might hold it in secret, when its impartation to the
ignorant would seem to be fraught with danger, and that error might be
properly substituted. The object was to save "Christians of the simpler
sort" from waters too deep for them. It is possible to defend the
practice if it be taken to represent the method of a skillful teacher,
who will not confuse the learner with principles beyond his
comprehension.[^139]

Gieseler remarks that "the Alexandrians regarded a certain accommodation
as necessary, which ventures to make use even of falsehood for the
attainment of a good end; nay, which was even obliged to do so."

Neander declares that \"the Orientals, according to their theory of
economy, allowed themselves many liberties not to be reconciled with the
strict laws of veracity.\"[^140]

Some of the fathers who had achieved a faith in Universalism, were
influenced by the mischievous notion that it was to be held
esoterically, cherished in secret, or only communicated to the chosen
few, --- withheld from the multitude, who would not appreciate it, and
even that the opposite error would, with some sinners, be more
beneficial than the truth.

Clement of Alexandria admits that he does not write or speak certain
truths.

Origen claims that there are doctrines not to be communicated to the
ignorant.

Clement says: \"They are not in reality liars who use
circumlocution[^141] because of the economy of salvation.\"

Origen refers to truths that must not be written.[^142]

Gieseler declares that the Alexandrians taught that falsehood could be
used to accomplish the good of men.

Origen said that \"all that might be said on this theme is not expedient
to explain now, or to all. For the mass need no further teaching on
account of those who hardly through the fear of *aeonian* punishment
restrain their recklessness.\"

The reader of the patristic literature sees this opinion frequently, and
unquestionably it caused many to hold out threats to the multitude in
order to restrain them; threats that they did not themselves believe
would be executed.[^143]

The gross and carnal interpretation given to parts of the Gospel,
causing some, as Origen said, to \"believe of God what would not be
believed of the crudest of mankind,\" caused him to dwell upon the duty
of reserve, which he does in many of his homilies. He says that he
cannot fully express himself on the mystery of eternal punishment in an
exoteric statement.[^144]

The reserve advocated and practiced by Origen and the Alexandrians was,
says Bigg, \"the screen of an esoteric belief.\"

Beecher reminds his readers that while it was common with Pagan
philosophers to teach false doctrines to the masses with the mistaken
idea that they were needful, "the fathers of the Christian church did
not escape the infection of this leprosy of pious fraud;" and he quotes
Neander to show that Chrysostom was guilty of it, and also Gregory
Nazianzen, Athanasius, and Basil the Great.

The prevalence of this *fraus pia* in the early centuries is well known
to scholars. After saying that the *Sibylline Oracles* were probably
forged by a gnostic, Mosheim says: \"I cannot yet take upon me to acquit
the most strictly orthodox from all participation in this species of
criminality; for it appears from evidence superior to all exception that
a pernicious maxim was current...namely, that those who made it their
business to deceive with a view of promoting the cause of truth, were
deserving rather of commendation than censure.\"

## What Was Held as to Doctrine.

It seems to have been held that "faith, the foundation of Christian
knowledge, was fitted only for the rude mass, the animal men, who were
incapable of higher things. Far above these were the privileged natures,
the men of intellect, or spiritual men, whose vocation was not to
believe but to know.\"[^145]

The ecclesiastical historians class as esoteric believers, Chrysostom
and Gregory Nazianzen; and Beecher names Athanasius and Basil the Great
as in the same category; and remarks: \"We cannot fully understand such
a proclamation of future endless punishment as has been described, while
it was not believed, until we consider the influence of Plato on the
age...Socrates is introduced as saying in Grote\'s Plato: \'It is
indispensable that this fiction should be circulated and accredited as
the fundamental, consecrated, unquestioned creed of the whole city, from
which the feeling of harmony and brotherhood among the citizens
springs.\' Such principles, as a leprosy, had corrupted the whole
community, and especially the leaders. In the Roman Empire pagan
magistrates and priests appealed to retribution in Tartarus, of which
they had no belief, to affect the masses. This does not excuse, but it
explains the preaching of eternal punishment by men who did not believe
it. They dared not entrust the truth to the masses, and so held it in
reserve --- to deter men from sin.\"

General as was the confession of a belief in universal salvation in the
church\'s first and best three centuries, there is ample reason to
believe that it was the secret belief of more than gave expression to
it, and that many a one who proclaimed a partial salvation, in his
secret \"heart of heart\" agreed with the greatest of the church\'s
fathers during the first four hundred years of our era, that Christ
would achieve a universal triumph, and that God would ultimately reign
in all hearts.

## Modern Theologians Equivocal.

There can be no doubt that many of the fathers threatened severer
penalties than they believed would be visited on sinners, impelled to
utter them because they considered them to be more salutary with the
masses than the truth itself. So that we may believe that some of the
patristic writers who seem to teach endless punishment did not believe
it. Others, we know, who accepted universal restoration employed, for
the sake of deterring sinners, threats that are inconsistent, literally
interpreted, with that doctrine. This disposition to conceal the truth
has actuated many a modem theologian. In Sermon 35, on the eternity of
hell torments Archbishop Tillotson, while he argues for the endless
duration of punishment, suggests that the Judge has the right to omit
inflicting it if he shall see it inconsistent with righteousness or
goodness to make sinners miserable forever, and Burnet urges: \"Whatever
your opinion is within yourself, and in your breast, concerning these
punishments, whether they are eternal or not, yet always with the
people, and when you preach to the people, use the received doctrine and
the received words in the sense in which the people receive them.\" It
is certainly allowable to think that many an ancient timid teacher
discovered the truth without daring to entrust it to the mass of
mankind.

## Even Lying Defended.

Theophilus of Alexandria proposed making Synesius of Cyrene, bishop. The
latter said: \"The philosophic intelligence, in short, while it beholds
the truth, admits the necessity of lying. Light corresponds to truth,
but the eye is dull of vision; it cannot without injury gaze on the
infinite light. As twilight is more comfortable for the eye, so, I hold,
is falsehood for the common run of people. The truth can only be harmful
for those who are unable to gaze on the reality. If the laws of the
priesthood permit me to hold this position, then I can accept
consecration, keeping my philosophy to myself at home, and preaching
fables out of doors.\"[^146]

# 5. Two Kindred Topics.

## Gospel Preached to the Dead.

The early Christian church almost, if not quite, universally believed
that Christ made proclamation of the Gospel to the dead in Hades.

Says Huidekoper; \"In the Second and Third Centuries every branch and
division of Christians believed that Christ preached to the
departed.\"[^147]

Dietelmaier declares[^148] this doctrine was believed by all Christians.
Of course, if souls were placed where their doom was irretrievable
salvation would not be offered to them; whence it follows that the early
Christians believed in post-mortem probation.

Allin says that \"some writers teach that the apostles also preached in
Hades. Some say that the Blessed Virgin did the same. Some even say that
Simeon went before Christ to Hades.\"

All these testimonies go to show that the earliest of the fathers did
not regard the grave as the deadline which the love of God could not
cross, but that the door of mercy is open hereafter as here.

\"The Platonic doctrine of a separate state, where the spirits of the
departed are purified, and on which the later doctrine of purgatory was
founded, was approved by all the expositors of Christianity who were of
the Alexandrian school, as was the custom of performing religious
services at the tombs of the dead. Nor was there much difference between
them and Tertullian in these particulars.\"

In the early ages of the church great stress was laid on 1 Peter 3:19:
"He (Christ) went and preached unto the spirits in prison." That this
doctrine was prevalent as late as Augustine\'s day is evident from the
fact that the doctrine is anathematized in his list of heresies ---
number 79. And even as late as the Ninth Century it was condemned by
Pope Boniface VI. It was believed that our Lord not only proclaimed his
Gospel to all the dead but that he liberated them all. How could it be
possible for a Christian to entertain the thought that all the wicked
who died before the advent of our Lord were released from bondage, and
that any who died after his advent would suffer endless woe?

Eusebius says: \"Christ, caring for the salvation of all...opened a way
of return to life for the dead bound in the chains of death.\"

Athanasius: \"The devil...cast out of Hades, sees all the fettered
beings led forth by the courage of the Savior.\"[^149]

Origen on 1 Kings 28:32: \"Jesus descended into Hades, and the prophets
before him, and they proclaim beforehand the coming of Christ.\"

Didymus observes \"In the liberation of all no one remains a captive; at
the time of the Lord\'s passion he alone (Satan) was injured, who lost
all the captives he was keeping.\"

Cyril of Alexandria: "And wandering down even to Hades he has emptied
the dark, secret, invisible treasuries."

Gregory of Nazianzus:[^150] "Until Christ loosed by his blood all who
groaned under Tartarian chains."

Jerome on Jonah 2:6: \"Our Lord was shut up in *aeonian* bars in order
that he might set free all who had been shut up.\"

Such passages might be multiplied, demonstrating that the early church
regarded the conquest by Christ of the departed as universal. He set
free from bonds all the dead in Hades. If the primitive Christians
believed that all the wicked of all the *aeons* preceding the death of
Christ were released, how can we suppose them to have regarded the
wicked subsequent to his death as destined to suffer interminable
torments?

Clement of Alexandria is explicit in declaring that the Gospel was
preached to all, both Jews and Gentiles, in Hades; --- that \"the sole
cause of the Lord\'s descent to the underworld was to preach the
gospel.\"[^151]

Origen says: \"Not only while Jesus was in the body did he win over not
a few only...but when he became a soul, without the covering of the
body, he dwelt among those souls (in Hades) which were without bodily
covering, converting such of them as were fit for it.\"

## The Gospel of Nicodemus.

About a century after the death of John appeared the apocryphal *Gospel
of Nicodemus*, valuable as setting forth current eschatology. It
describes the effect of Christ\'s preaching in Hades: \"When Jesus
arrived in Hades, the gates burst open, and taking Adam by the hand
Jesus said, 'Come all with me, as many as have died through the tree
which he touched, for behold I raise you all up through the tree of the
cross.\" This book shows conclusively that the Christians of that date
did not regard *aeonian* punishment as interminable, inasmuch as those
who had been sentenced to that condition were released.

\"If Christ preached to dead men who were once disobedient, then
Scripture shows us that the moment of death does not necessarily involve
a final and hopeless torment for every sinful soul. Of all the blunt
weapons of ignorant controversy employed against those to whom has been
revealed the possibility of a larger hope than is left to mankind by
Augustine or by Calvin, the bluntest is the charge that such a hope
renders null the necessity for the work of Christ....We thus rescue the
work of redemption from the appearance of having failed to achieve its
end for the vast majority of those for whom Christ died...In these
passages, as has been truly said, \'we may see an expansive paraphrase
and exuberant variation of the original Pauline theme of the
universalism of the evangelic embassage of Christ, and of his
sovereignty over the world;\' and especially of the passage in the
Philippians (2:9-11) where all they that are in heaven and on the earth
and under the earth, are enumerated as classes of the subjects of the
exalted Redeemer.\"[^152]

And Alford observes: \"The inference every intelligent reader will draw
from the fact here announced: it is not purgatory; it is not universal
restitution; but it is one which throws blessed light on one of the
darkest enigmas of divine justice.\"

Timotheus II, patriarch of the Nestorians, wrote that \"by the prayers
of the saints the souls of sinners may pass from Gehenna to
Paradise.\"[^153]

Says Uhlhorn[^154]: \"For deceased persons their relatives brought gifts
on the anniversary of their death, a beautiful custom which vividly
exhibited the connection between the church above and the church
below.\"

\"One fact stands out very clearly from the pages of patristic
literature, viz.: that all sects and divisions of the Christians in the
second and third centuries united in the belief that Christ went down
into Hades, or the Underworld, after his death on the cross, and
remained there until his resurrection. Of course it was natural that the
question should come up, What did he do there? As he came down from
earth to preach the Gospel to, and save, the living, it was easy to
infer that he went down into Hades to preach the same glad tidings
there, and show the way of salvation to those who had died before his
advent.\"[^155]

## Prayers for the Dead. 

It need not here be claimed that the doctrine that Christ literally
preached to the dead in Hades is true, or that such is the teaching of 1
Pet. 3:19 but it is perfectly apparent that if the primitive Christians
held to the doctrine they could not have believed that the condition of
the soul is fixed at death. That is comparatively a modern doctrine.

There can be no doubt that the Catholic doctrine of purgatory is a
corruption of the Scriptural doctrine of the disciplinary character of
all God\'s punishments. Purgatory was never heard of in the earlier
centuries.[^156] It is first fully stated by Pope **Gregory the First**,
\"its inventor,\" at the close of the Sixth Century. "For some light
faults we must believe that there is before judgment a purgatorial
fire." This theory is a perversion of the idea held anciently, that all
God\'s punishments are purgative; what the Catholic regards as true of
the errors of the good is just as true of the sins of the worst, ---
indeed, of all. The word rendered punishment in Matthew 25:46,
(*kolasin*) implies all this.

## Condition of the Dead not Final.

That the condition of the dead was not regarded as inalterably fixed is
evident from the fact that prayers for the dead were customary
anciently, and that, too, before the doctrine of purgatory was
formulated. The living believed --- and so should we believe --- that
the dead have migrated to another country, where the good offices of
survivors on earth avail. Perpetua begged for the help of her brother,
child of a Pagan father, who had died unbaptized. In Tertullian the
widow prays for the soul of her departed husband. Repentance by the dead
is conceded by Clement, and the prayers of the good on earth help them.

The dogma of the purificatory character of future punishment did not
degenerate into the doctrine of punishment for believers only, until the
Fourth Century; nor did that error crystallize into the Catholic
purgatory until later.

Hagenbach says: \"Comparing Gregory\'s doctrine with the earlier, and
more spiritual notions concerning the efficacy of the purifying fire of
the intermediate state, we may adopt the statement of Schmidt that the
belief in a lasting desire of perfection, which death itself cannot
quench, degenerated into a belief in purgatory.\"

Plumptre[^157] has a valuable statement: \"In every form; from the
solemn liturgies which embodied the belief of her profoundest thinkers
and truest worshipers, to the simple words of hope and love which were
traced over the graves of the poor, her voice (the church of the first
ages) went up without a doubt or misgiving, in prayers for the souls of
the departed;\" showing that they could not have regarded their
condition as unalterably fixed at death.

Prof. Plumptre quotes from Lee\'s *Christian Doctrine of Prayer for the
Departed*, to show the early Christians\' belief that intercessions for
the dead would be of avail to them. Even Augustine accepted the
doctrine. He prayed after his mother\'s death, that her sins might be
forgiven, and that his father might also receive pardon.[^158]

\"The Platonic doctrine of a separate state where the spirits of the
departed are purified, and on which the later doctrine of purgatory was
founded, was approved by all the expositors of Christianity who were of
the Alexandrian school, as was the custom of performing religious
services at the tombs of the dead.\"

Uhlhorn gives similar testimony: \"For deceased persons their relatives
brought gifts on the anniversary of their death, a beautiful custom,
which vividly exhibited the connection between the church above and the
church below.\"

Origen\'s tenet of Catharsis or Purification was absorbed by the growing
belief in purgatory.[^159]

## Important Thoughts. 

Let the reader reflect:

\(1\) that the Primitive Christians so distrusted the effect of the
truth on the popular mind that they withheld it, and only cherished it
esoterically, and held up terrors for effect, in which they had no
faith;

\(2\) that they prayed for the wicked dead that they might be released
from suffering;

\(3\) that they universally held that Christ preached the Gospel to
sinners in Hades;

\(4\) that the earliest creeds are entirely silent as to the idea that
the wicked dead were in irretrievable and endless torment;

\(5\) that the terms used by some who are accused of teaching endless
torment were precisely those employed by those acknowledged to have been
Universalists;

\(6\) that the first Christians were the happiest of people and infused
a wonderful cheerfulness into a world of sorrow and gloom;

\(7\) that there is not a shade of darkness nor a note of despair in any
one of the thousands of epitaphs in the Catacombs;

\(8\) that the doctrine of universal redemption was first made prominent
by those to whom Greek was their native tongue, and that they declared
that they derived it from the Greek Scriptures, while endless punishment
was first taught by Africans and Latins, who derived it from a foreign
tongue of which the great teacher of it confessed he was ignorant (See
\"Augustine\" later on). Let the reader give to these considerations
their full and proper weight, and it will be impossible to believe that
the fathers regarded the impenitent as consigned at death to hopeless
and endless woe.

## Note.

After giving the emphatic language of Clement and Origen and other
ancient Christians declarative of universal holiness, Dr. Bigg, in his
valuable book, *The Christian Platonists of Alexandria*, frequently
quoted in these pages, remarks:[^160] \"Neither Clement nor Origen is,
properly speaking, a Universalist. Nor is Universalism the logical
result of their principles.\" The reasons he gives are two: (1) They
believed in the freedom of the will; and (2) they did not deny the
eternity of punishment, because the soul that has sinned beyond a
certain point can never become what it might have been!

To which it is only necessary to say (1) that Universalists generally
accept the freedom of the will, and (2) no soul that has sinned, as all
have sinned, can ever become what it might have been, so that Dr.
Bigg\'s premises would necessitate not Universalism, but universal
condemnation!

And, as if to contradict his own words Dr. Bigg adds in the very next
paragraph: \"The hope of a general restitution of all souls through
suffering to purity and blessedness, lingered on in the East for some
time;\" and the last words in his book are these: \"It is the teaching
of St. Paul, --- Then Cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up
the Kingdom to God, even the Father. Then shall the Son also himself be
subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in
all.\"

And these are the last words of his last note: \"At the end all will be
one because the Father\'s will is all in all and all in each. Each will
fill the place which the mystery of the economy assigns to him.\"

It would be interesting to learn what sort of a monstrosity Dr. Bigg has
constructed and labeled with the word which he declares could not be
applied to Clement and Origen.

# 6. The Apostles' Immediate Successors. 

## The First Christians not Explicit in Eschatological Matters.

As we read the writings of the immediate successors of the apostles, we
discover that matters of eschatology do not occupy their thought. They
dwell on the advent of our Lord and dilate on its blessings to the
world; they give the proofs of his divinity, and appeal to men to accept
his religion. Most of the surviving documents of the First Century are
hortatory. It was an apologetic, not a polemic age.

A very partisan author, anxious to show that the doctrine of endless
punishment was bequeathed to their immediate successors by the apostles,
concedes this. He says that the first Christians \"touched but lightly
and incidentally on points of doctrine,\" but gave "the doctrines of
Christianity in the very words of Scripture, giving us often no certain
clew to their interpretations of the language.\"[^161]

The first Christians were converted Jews, Greeks, Egyptians, Romans,
differing in their theologies, and only agreeing in accepting Christ and
Christianity; their ideas of our Lord\'s teaching concerning human
destiny and on other subjects were tinctured by their antecedent
predilections. Their doctrines on many points were colored by Jewish and
Pagan errors, until their minds were clarified, when the more systematic
teachers came, --- Clement, Origen and others, who eliminated the errors
Christian converts had brought with them from former associations and
presented Christianity as Christ taught it. The measures of meal were
more or less impure until the leaven of genuine Christianity transformed
them. But it is conceded that there is little left of the apostolic age,
out of the New Testament, to tell us what their ideas of human destiny
were.

It is probable, however, that the Pharisaic notion of a partial
resurrection and the annihilation of the wicked was held by some, and
the heathen ideas of endless punishment by others. We know that even
while the apostles lived some of the early Christians had accepted new,
or retained ancient errors, for which they were reprimanded by the
apostles. \"False teachers\" and \"philosophy and vain deceit\" were
alleged of them, and it is the testimony of scholars that errors
abounded among them, errors that Christianity did not at first exorcise.
But the questions concerning human destiny were not at all raised at
first. True views and false ones undoubtedly prevailed, brought into the
new communion from former associations. And it is conceded that while
very little literature on the subject remains, there is enough to show
that they differed, at first, and until wiser teachers systematized our
religion, and sifted out the wheat from the chaff.

## Views of Clement of Rome.

The first of the apostolic fathers was Clement of Rome, who was bishop
from 85 AD. Eusebius and Origen thought he was Paul\'s fellow laborer.
His famous (first) epistle of fifty-nine chapters is about the length of
Mark\'s Gospel. He appeals to the destruction of the cities of Rome to
illustrate the divine punishments but gives no hint of the idea of
endless woe, though he devotes three chapters to the resurrection. He
has been thought to have held to a partial resurrection, for he asks:
\"Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the maker of all
things to raise up again those who have proudly served him in the
assurance of a good faith?\" But this does not prove he held to the
annihilation of the wicked, for Theophilus and Origen use similar
language. He says: \"Let us reflect how free from wrath he is towards
all his creatures.\" God "does good to all, but most abundantly to us
who have fled for refuge to his compassions," etc. God is "the
all-merciful and beneficent Father." Neander affirms that he had the
Pauline spirit, \"with love as the motive," and A. St. J. Chambré, D.
D.,[^162] thinks \"he probably believed in the salvation of all men,\"
and **Allin**[^163] refers to Rufinus and says, \"from which we may, I
think, infer, that Clement, with other fathers, was a believer in the
larger hope.\" It cannot be said that he has left anything positive in
relation to the subject, though it is probable that Chambré and Allin
have correctly characterized him.

He wrote a Greek epistle to the Corinthians which was lost for
centuries, but was often quoted by subsequent writers, and whose
contents were therefore only known in fragments. It was probably written
before John\'s Gospel. It was at length found complete, bound with the
Alexandrian codex. It was read in church before and at the time of
Eusebius, and even as late as the Fifth Century.

## Polycarp a Destructionist.

Polycarp was bishop of the church in Smyrna, 108-117 AD. He is thought
to have been John\'s disciple. Irenaeus tells us that he and Ignatius
were friends of Peter and John and related what they had told them. His
only surviving epistle contains this passage: To Christ "all things are
made subject, both that are in heaven and that are on earth; whom every
living creature shall worship; who shall come to judge the quick and
dead; whose blood God shall require of them that believe not in him." He
also says in the same chapter: \"He who raised up Christ from the dead,
will also raise us up if we do his will,\" implying that the
resurrection depended, as he thought, on conduct in this life. It seems
probable that he was one of those who held to the Pharisaic doctrine of
a partial resurrection. And yet this is only the most probable
conjecture. There is nothing decisive in his language. When the
proconsul Statius Quadratus wrote to Polycarp, threatening him with
burning, the saint replied "You threaten me with a fire that burns for
an hour, and is presently extinct, but art ignorant, alas, of the fire
of *aionian* condemnation, and the judgment to come, reserved for the
wicked in the other world."

After Polycarp there was no literature that has descended to us, for
several years, except a few quotations in later writings, which,
however, contain nothing bearing on our theme, from Papias, Quadratus,
Agrippa, Castor, etc.

## The Martyria.

*The Martyrdom of Polycarp* purports to be a letter from the church of
Smyrna reciting the particulars of his death. But though it is the
earliest of the Martyria, it is supposed to have a much later date than
it alleges, and much has been interpolated by its transcribers. Eusebius
omits much of it. It speaks of the fire that is "*aionion* punishment,\"
and it is probable that the writer gave these terms the same sense that
is given them by the Scriptures, Origen, Gregory and other Universalist
writings and authors.

## Tatian.

Tatian states the doctrine of endless punishment very strongly. He was a
philosophical Platonist more than a Christian. He was a heathen convert
and repeats the heathen doctrines in language unknown to the New
Testament though common enough in heathen works. He calls punishment
\"death through punishment in immortality,\"[^164] terms used by
Josephus and the Pagans, but never found in the New Testament. His
*Diatessaron*, a collection of the Gospels, is of real value in
determining the existence of the Gospels in the Second Century.

## Barnabas's "Way of Death."

The Epistle of Barnabas was written by an Alexandrian Gnostic, probably
about 70 to 120 AD, not, as has been claimed, by Paul\'s companion, and
yet some of the best authorities think the author of the Epistle was the
friend of Paul. Though often quoted by the ancients, the first four and
a half chapters of the Epistle were only known in a Latin version until
the entire Greek was discovered and published in 1863. It is the only
Christian composition written while the New Testament was being written,
except the "Wisdom of Solomon." It is of small intrinsic value, and
sheds but little light on eschatology. The first perfect manuscript was
found with the Sinaitic manuscript of Tischendorf, a translation of
which is given by Samuel Sharpe.[^165] It was the first document after
the New Testament to apply *aionios* to punishment; but there is nothing
in the connection to show that it was used in any other than its
Scriptural sense, indefinite duration. It is quoted by Origen in *Contra
Celsus*, and by Clement of Alexandria. It is chiefly remarkable for
standing alone among writings contemporary with the New Testament. The
phrase, *eis ton aiona*, \"to the age,\" mistranslated in the New
Testament \"forever\" (though correctly rendered in the margin of the
Revision), is employed by Barnabas and applied to the rewards of
goodness and the evil consequences of ill doing. He says, \"The way of
the Black one is an age-lasting way of death and punishment,\" but the
description accompanying shows that the Way and its results are confined
to this life, for he precedes it by disclaiming all questions of
eschatology. He says: \"If I should write to you about things that are
future you would not understand.\" And when he speaks of God he says:
\"He is Lord from ages and to ages, but he (Satan) is prince of the
present time of wickedness.\" Long duration but not strict eternity
seems to have been in his mind when he referred to the consequences of
wickedness. This is confirmed by the following language "He that chooses
those (evil) things will be destroyed together with his works. For the
sake of this there will be a resurrection, for the sake of this a
repayment. The day is at hand in which all things will perish together
with the evil one. The Lord is at hand and his reward." Barnabas
probably held the Scriptural view of punishment, long-lasting but
limited, though he employs *timioria* (torment) instead of *kolasis*
(correction) for punishment.

## The Shepherd or Pastor of Hermas.

In the middle of the Second Century, say 141 to 156 AD, a book entitled
the \"Shepherd,\" or "Pastor of Hermas," was read in the churches, and
was regarded as almost equal to the Scriptures. The author was
commissioned to write it by Clemens Romanus. Irenaeus, Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius and Athanasius quote from it, and rank it
among the sacred writings. Clement says it is \"divinely expressed,\"
and Origen calls it \"divinely inspired.\" Irenaeus designates the book
as \"The Scripture.\"

According to Rothe, Hefele, and the editors of *Bib. Max. Patrum*,
Hermas teaches the possibility of repentance after death, but seems to
imply the annihilation of the wicked. Farrar says that the parable of
the tower \"certainly taught a possible amelioration after death: for a
possibility of repentance and so of being built into the tower is
granted to some of the rejected stones.\" The \"Pastor\" does not avow
Universalism, but he is much further from the eschatology of the church
for the last fifteen centuries, than from universal restoration. Only
fragments of this work were preserved for a long time, and they were in
a Latin translation, until 1859, when one-fourth of the original Greek
was discovered. This, with the fragments previously possessed, and the
Ethiopian version, give us the full text of this ancient document. The
book is a sort of Ante-Nicene *Pilgrim\'s Progress*[^166] --- an
incoherent imitation of Revelation.[^167] The theology of the
\"Shepherd\" can be gauged from his language: \"Put on, therefore,
gladness, that has always favor before God, and is acceptable unto him,
and delight yourself in it; for every man that is glad does the things
that are good, but thinks good thoughts, despising grief.\" How
different this sentiment from that which prevailed later, when saints
mortified body and soul, and made religion the apotheosis of melancholy
and despair.

## Ignatius Probably a Destructionist.

Of some fifteen epistles ascribed to Ignatius, it has been settled by
modern scholarship that seven are genuine. There are passages in these
that seem to indicate that he believed in the annihilation of the
wicked. He was probably a convert from heathenism who had not gotten rid
of his former opinions. He says: \"It would have been better for them to
love that they might rise.\" If he believed in a partial resurrection he
could not have used words that denote endless consequences to sin any
more than did Origen, for if annihilation followed those consequences,
they must be limited.

When Ignatius and Barnabas speak of \"eternal\" punishment or death, we
might perhaps suppose that they regarded the punishment of sin as
endless, did we not find that Origen and other Universalists used the
same terms, and did we not know that the Scriptures do the same. To find
*aionion* attached to punishment proves nothing as to its duration. In
his *Epist. ad. Trail.*, he says that Christ descended into Hades and
cleft the *aionion* barrier.

It seems on the whole probable that while Ignatius did not dogmatize on
human destiny, he regarded the resurrection as conditional. But here, as
elsewhere, the student should remember that the pernicious doctrine of
\"reserve\" or "economy" continually controlled the minds of the early
Christian teachers, so that they not only withheld their real views of
the future, lest ignorant people should take advantage of God\'s
goodness, but threatened consequences of sin to sinners, in order to
supply the inducements that they thought the masses of people required
to deter them from sin. Dr. Ballou thinks that this father held that the
wicked "will not be raised from the dead, but exist hereafter as
incorporeal spirits." He was martyred in 107 AD.

## Justin Martyr's Views.

Justin Martyr, 89-166 AD, is the first scholar produced by the Church,
and the first conspicuous father the authenticity of whose writings is
not disputed. His surviving works are his two *Apologies*, and his
*Dialogue with Trypho*. It is difficult to ascertain his exact views.

Cave says: \"Justin Martyr maintains that the souls of good men are not
received into heaven until the resurrection...that the souls of the
wicked are thrust into a worse condition, where they expect the judgment
of the great day.\"

Justin himself says that "the punishment is age-long chastisement
(*aionion kolasin*) and not for a thousand years as Plato says,\" (in
*Phoedra*). "It is unlimited; men are chastised for an unlimited period,
and the kingdom is *aionion* and the chastening fire (*kolasis puros*)
*aionion*, too. "God delays the destruction of the world, which will
cause wicked angels and demons and men to cease to exist, in order to
their repentance...Some which appeared worthy of God never die, others
are punished as long as God wills them to exist and be punished...Souls
both die and are punished." He calls the fire of punishment unquenchable
(*asbeston*). He sometimes seems to have taught a pseudo-Universalism,
that is, the salvation of all who should be permitted to be immortal; at
other times endless punishment. Again he favors universal salvation. He
not only condemned those who forbade the reading of the *Sibylline
Oracles*, but commended the book. His language is, \"We not only read
them without fear, but offer them for inspection, knowing that they will
appear well-pleasing to all.\" As the *Oracles* distinctly advocate
universal salvation, it is not easy to believe that Justin discarded
their teachings. And yet he says: \"If the death of wicked men had ended
in insensibility,\" it would have been a \"god-send\" to them. Instead,
he says, death is followed by *aionion* punishment. If he used the word
as Origen did, the two statements are reconcilable with each other.
Justin taught a \"general and everlasting resurrection and judgment.
Body and soul are to be raised and the wicked with the devil and his
angels, and demons, sent to Gehenna[^168]\...Christ has declared that
Satan and his host, together with those men who follow him, shall be
sent into fire, and punished for an endless period.[^169]\" But it may
be that he speaks rhetorically, and not literally. It is the general
opinion, however, that he regarded punishment as limited, to be followed
by annihilation. He himself says: \"The soul, therefore, partakes of
life, because God wills it should live; and, accordingly, it will not
partake of life whenever God shall will that it should not live.\" And
yet he says that bodies are consumed in the fire, and at the same time
remain immortal.

Justin was a heathen philosopher before his conversion, and his
Christianity is of a mongrel type. He wore a pagan philosopher\'s robe,
or pallium, after his conversion, calls himself a Platonist, and always
seems half a heathen. His effort appears to be to fuse Christianity and
Paganism, and it is not easy to harmonize his statements. His Pagan
idiosyncrasies colored his Christianity. But, as Farrar says, the
theology of the first one or two centuries had not been crystallized,
the "language was fluid and un-technical, and great stress should not be
laid on the expressions of the earliest fathers. He nowhere calls
punishment endless, but *aionion*; and yet it cannot be proved that he
was at all aware of the true philosophic meaning of *aionios* as a word
expressive of quality, and exclusive of --- or rather the absolute
antithesis to--- time. He says that demons and wicked men will be
punished for a boundless age (*aperanto aiona*), but in some passages he
seems to be at least uncertain whether God may not will that evil souls
should cease to exist.\"[^170] When Justin says that transgressors are
to remain deathless (*athanata*) while devoured by the worm and fire,
may he not mean that they cannot die while thus exposed? So, too, when
he uses the word *aionios*, and says the sinner must undergo punishment
during that period, why not read literally \"for ages, and not as Plato
said, for a thousand years only?\"

When, therefore, these terms are found unexplained, as in Justin Martyr,
they should be read in the bright light cast upon them by the
interpretations of Clement and Origen, who employ them as forcibly as
does Justin, but who explain them --- \"eternal fire\" and \"everlasting
punishment\" --- as in perfect harmony with the great fact of universal
restoration. Doctor Farrar regards Justin Martyr as holding \"views more
or less analogous to Universalism.\"[^171]

We cannot do better here than to quote Hosea Ballou:[^172]

\"The question turns on the construction of a single passage. Justin had
argued that souls are not, in their own nature, immortal, since they
were created, or begotten; and whatever thus begins to exist, may come
to an end. \'But, still, I do not say that souls wholly die; for that
would truly be good fortune to the bad. What then? The souls of the
pious dwell in a certain better place; but those of the unjust and
wicked, in a worse place, expecting the time of judgment. Thus, those
who are judged of God to be worthy, die no more; but the others are
punished as long as God shall will that they should exist and be
punished...For, whatever is, or ever shall be, subsequent to God, has a
corruptible nature, and is such as may be abolished and cease to exist,
God alone is unbegotten and incorruptible, and, therefore, he is God;
but everything else, subsequent to him, is begotten and corruptible. For
this reason, souls both die and are punished.\"[^173]

### Punishment Not Endless: The Epistle to Diognetus.

This letter was long ascribed to Justin Martyr, but it is now generally
regarded as anonymous. It was written not far from 100 AD, perhaps by
Marcion, possibly by Justin Martyr. It is a beautiful composition, full
of the most apostolic spirit. It has very little belonging to our theme,
except that at the close of Chapter 10 it speaks of "those who shall be
condemned to the *aionion* fire which shall chastise those who are
committed to it even unto an end,"[^174] (*mechri telous*). Even if
*aionion* usually meant endless, it is limited here by the word \"unto\"
which has the force of until, as does *aidios* in Jude 6, --- \"*aidios*
chains under darkness, unto (or until) the judgment of the great day.\"
Such a limited chastisement, it would seem, could only be believed in by
one who regarded God as Diognetus\'s correspondent did, as one who
"still is, was always, and ever will be kind and good, and free from
wrath."

This brief passage shows us that at the beginning of the Second Century
Christians dwelt upon the severity of the penalties of sin but
supplemented them by restoration wherever they had occasion to refer to
the ultimate outcome. A few years later (as will appear further on) when
Christianity was systematized by Clement and Origen, this was fully
shown, and explains the obscurities, and sometimes the apparent
incongruities of earlier writers. The lovely spirit and sublime ethics
of this epistle foreshadow the Christian theology so soon to be fully
developed by Clement and Origen. Bunsen thinks[^175] the letter
\"indisputably, after Scripture, the finest monument we know of sound
Christian feeling, noble courage, and manly eloquence.\"

## Irenaeus.

Irenaeus (120 AD, died 202) was a friend of Ignatius, and says that in
his youth he saw Polycarp, who was contemporary with John. He had known
several who had personally listened to the apostles. His principal work,
*Against Heresies*, was written 182 to 188 AD. No complete copy of it
exists in the original Greek: only a Latin translation is extant, though
a part of the first book is found in Greek in the copious quotations
from it in the writings of Hippolytus and Epiphanius. Its authority is
weakened by the wretched Latin in which most of it stands. One fact,
however, is incontrovertible: he did not regard Universalism as among
the heresies of his times, for he nowhere condemns it, though the
doctrine is contained in the *Sibylline Oracles*, then in general use,
and though he mentions the doctrine without disapproval in his
description of the theology of the Carpocratians.

### Interesting Exposition of Irenaeus.

Irenaeus has been quoted as teaching that the Apostles' Creed was meant
to inculcate endless punishment, because in a paraphrase of that
document he says that the Judge, at the final assize, will cast the
wicked into \"eternal\" fire. But the terms he uses are "*ignum
aeternum*" (*aionion pur*). As just stated, though he reprehends the
Carpocratians for teaching the transmigration of souls, he declares
without protest that they explain the text \"until thou pay the
uttermost farthing,\" as inculcating the idea that \"all souls are
saved.\" Irenaeus says: \"God drove Adam out of Paradise, and removed
him far from the tree of life, in compassion for him, that he might not
remain a transgressor always, and that the sin in which he was involved
might not be immortal, nor be without end and incurable. He prevented
further transgression by the interposition of death, and by causing sin
to cease by the dissolution of the flesh...that man ceasing to live to
sin, and dying to it, might begin to live to God.\"

### The Creed of Irenaeus.

Irenaeus states the creed of the church in his day, 160 AD, as a belief
in "one God, the Father Almighty. Maker of heaven and earth, and the
sea, and all things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son
of God, who became incarnate for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit
who proclaimed through the prophets the dispensation of God, and the
advents, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the
resurrection from the dead, and the ascension into heaven in the flesh
of the beloved Christ Jesus our Lord, and his manifestation from heaven
in the glory of the Father \'to gather all things in one,\' (Ephesians
1:10) and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human race, in order
that to Christ Jesus, our Lord, and God, and Savior, and King, according
to the will of the invisible Father, 'every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that
every tongue should confess to him,' (Philippians 2:10, 11) and that he
should execute just judgment towards all; that he may send \'spiritual
wickedness,\' (Ephesians 6:12) and the angels who transgressed and
became apostates, together with the ungodly and unrighteous, and wicked
and profane among men, into *aionion* fire; and may in the exercise of
his grace, confer immortality upon the righteous, and holy, and those
who have kept his commandments, and have persevered in his love, some
from the beginning, and others from their repentance, and may surround
them with everlasting glory.\"

The reader must not forget that the use of the phrase, *aionion* fire,
does not give any color to the idea that Irenaeus taught endless
punishment, for Origen, Clement, Gregory Nyssen, and other Universalists
conveyed their ideas of punishment by the use of the same terms, and
held that salvation is beyond, and even by means of the *aionion* fire
and punishment.

### Probably a Universalist.

Schaff admits that the opinions of Irenaeus are doubtful from his[^176]
orthodox standpoint and says:[^177] \"In the fourth Pfaffian fragment
ascribed to him (Stieren I, 889) he says that 'Christ will come at the
end of time to destroy all evil[^178] and to reconcile all things
---[^179] from Col. 1:20 --- that there may be an end of all impurity.'
This passage, like 1 Cor. 15:28, and Col. 1:20, looks toward universal
restoration rather than annihilation,\" but good, orthodox Dr. Schaff
admits that it, like the Pauline passages, allows an interpretation
consistent with eternal punishment.[^180]

Dr. Beecher writes that Irenaeus \"taught a final restitution of all
things to unity and order by the annihilation of all the finally
impenitent...The inference from this is plain. He did not understand
*aionios* in the sense of eternal; but in the sense claimed by Prof.
Lewis, that is, 'pertaining to the world to come,'\" not endless.
Irenaeus thought \"that man should not last forever as a sinner and that
the sin which was in him might not be immortal and infinite and
incurable.\"

### Bunsen's View.

Says Bunsen: "The eternal decree of redemption, is, to Irenaeus,
throughout, an act of God\'s love. The atonement, is, according to him,
a satisfaction paid, not to God, but to the Devil, under whose power the
human mind and body were lying. But the Devil himself only serves God\'s
purpose, for nothing can resist to the last, the Almighty power of
divine love, which works not by constraint (the Devil\'s way), but by
persuasion.\"[^181] The different statements of Irenaeus are hard to
reconcile with each other, but a fair inference from his language seems
to be that he hovered between the doctrines of annihilation and endless
punishment, and yet leaned not a little hopefully to that of
restoration. He certainly says that death ends sin, which forecloses all
idea of endless torments. It is probable that the fathers differed, as
their successors have since differed, according to antecedent and
surrounding influences, and their own idiosyncrasies.

Of Christian writers up to date, all assert future punishment, seven
apply the word rendered everlasting (*aionios*) to it; three, certainly
did not regard it as endless, two holding to annihilation and one to
universal restoration. Remembering, however, the doctrine of Reserve, we
can by no means be certain that the heathen words used denoting absolute
endlessness were not used \"pedagogically,\" to deter sinners from sin.

## Quadratus.

Quadratus, 131 AD, addressed an Apology to the Emperor Adrian, a
fragment of which survives, but there is no word in it relating to the
final condition of mankind.

## Pseudo-Clementine Homilies.

The Clementine Homilies, once thought to have been written by Clement of
Rome, but properly entitled by Baur \"Pseudo Clementine,\" the work of
some Gnostic Christian --- teach the final triumph of good. One passage
speaks of the destruction of the wicked by the punishment of fire,
\"punished with *aionion* fire,\" but this is more than canceled by
other passages in which it is clearly taught that the Devil is but a
temporal evil, a servant of good, and agent of God, who, with all his
evil works, are finally to be transformed into good. On the one hand,
the Devil is not properly an evil, but a God-serving being; on the
other, there is a final transformation of the Devil, of the evil into
good. The sentiments of the Homilies seem, however, somewhat
contradictory.

It is an important consideration not always realized, when studying the
opinions that prevailed in the primitive church, that the earliest
copies of the Gospels were not in existence until 60 AD; that the first
Epistle written by Paul --- 1 Thessalonians --- was not written till 52
AD; that the New Testament canon was not completed until 170 AD; that
for a long time the only Christian Bible was the Old Testament;[^182]
that the account of the judgment in Matthew 25 is never referred to in
the writings of the apostolic fathers, who probably never saw or heard
of it till towards the end of the Second Century; and, therefore, when
considering the opinions of the fathers for at least a century and a
half, we must in all cases interpret them by the Old Testament, which
scholars of all churches concede does not reveal the doctrine of endless
woe. Probably not a single Christian writer heretofore quoted ever saw a
copy of the Gospels.

## Athenagoras.

Athenagoras wrote an \"Apology,\" about 178 AD, and a \"Treatise on the
Resurrection.\" He was a scholar and a philosopher, and made great
efforts to convert the heathen to Christianity. He declared that there
shall be a judgment, the award of which shall be distributed according
to conduct; but he nowhere refers to the duration of punishment. He was,
however, the head of the Catechetical school in Alexandria, before
Pantaenus, and must have shared the Universalist views of Pantaenus,
Clement and Origen, his successors.

## Theophilus.

Theophilus (180 AD). This author has left a \"Treatise\" on behalf of
Christianity, addressed to Autolycus, a learned heathen. He uses current
language on the subject of punishment, but says: \"Just as a vessel,
which, after it has been made, has some flaw, is remade or remodeled,
that it may become new and right, so it comes to man by death. For, in
some way or other he is broken up, that he may come forth in the
resurrection whole, I mean spotless, and righteous, and immortal.\"

## Conclusion.

The preceding writers were \"orthodox,\" but there were at the same time
Gnostic Christians, none of whose writings remain except in quotations
contained in orthodox authors, with the exception of a few fragments.
They seem to have amalgamated Christianity with Orientalism. But they
have been so misrepresented by their opponents that it is very difficult
to arrive at their real opinions on all subjects. Happily they speak
distinctly on human destiny.

# 7. Three Gnostic Sects. 

Three Gnostic sects flourished nearly simultaneously in the Second
Century, all of which accepted universal salvation: the Basilidians, the
Valentinians, and the Carpocratians.

## The Basilidians.

The Basilidians were followers of Basilides, who lived about 117-138 AD.
He was a Gnostic Christian and an Egyptian philosopher. He wrote an
alleged Gospel --- exegetical rather than historical --- no trace of
which remains. As some of his theories did not agree with those
generally advocated by Christians, he and his followers were regarded as
heretics and their writings were destroyed, though no evidence exists to
show that their view of human destiny was obnoxious. Greek philosophy
and Christian faith are mingled in the eclecticism of the Basilidians.
Basilides taught that man\'s universal redemption will result from the
birth and death of Christ. According to the *Dictionary of Christian
Biography*,[^183] Hippolytus gives an exposition of this mystic
Christian sect. Basilides himself was a sincere Christian, and \"the
first Gnostic teacher who has left an individual, personal stamp upon
the age.\"[^184] He accepted the entire Gospel narrative, and taught
that the wicked will be condemned to migrate into the bodies of men or
animals until purified, when they will be saved with all the rest of
mankind. He did not pretend that his ideas of transmigration were
obtained from the Scriptures but affirmed that he derived them from
philosophy. He held that the doctrines of Christianity have a two-fold
character --- one phase simple, popular, obtained from the plain reading
of the New Testament; the other sublime, secret, mysteriously imparted
to favored ones. His system was a sort of Egyptian metempsychosis
grafted on Christianity, an Oriental mysticism endeavoring to stand on a
Christian foundation, and thus solve the problem of human destiny. Man
and nature are represented as struggling upwards. \"The restoration of
all things that in the beginning were established in the seed of the
universe shall be restored in their own season.\"

Irenaeus charges the Basilidians with immorality, but Clement, who knew
them better, denies it, and defends them.[^185]

## The Carpocratians.

The Carpocratians were followers of Carpocrates, a Platonic philosopher,
who incorporated some of the elements of the Christian religion into his
system of philosophy. The sect flourished in Egypt and the vicinity
early in the Second Century. Like the Basilidians they called themselves
Gnostics and inculcated a somewhat similar set of theories. Irenaeus
says that the Carpocratians explained the text: \"Thou shalt not go out
thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing,\" as teaching "that
no one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but
that he must pass from body to body until he has experience of every
kind of action which can be practiced in this world, and when nothing is
wanting longer to him, then his liberated soul should soar upwards to
that God who is above the angels, the makers of the world. In this way
all souls are saved,\" etc. But while Irenaeus calls the Carpocratians a
heretical sect, and denounces some of their tenets, he had no hard words
for their doctrine of man\'s final destiny.

## The Valentinians.

The Valentinians (130 AD) taught that all souls will be finally admitted
to the realms of bliss. They denied the resurrection of the body. Their
doctrines were widely disseminated in Asia, Africa and Europe, after the
death of their Egyptian founder, Valentine. They resembled the teachings
of Basilides in efforts to solve the problem of human destiny
philosophically. Valentine flourished in Rome from 129 to 132 AD. A
devout Christian, and a man of the highest genius, he was never accused
of anything worse than heresy. He was \"a pioneer in Christian
theology.\" His was an attempt to show, in dramatic form, how "the work
of universal redemption is going on to the ever-increasing glory of the
ineffable and unfathomable Father, and the ever-increasing blessedness
of souls.\" There was a germ of truth in the hybrid Christian theogony
and Hellenic philosophizing that made up Valentinianism. It was a
struggle after the only view of human destiny that can satisfy the human
heart.

## Conclusions.

These three sects were bitterly opposed by the "orthodox" fathers in
some of their tenets, but their Universalism was never condemned.

## Phases of Gnosticism.

It would be interesting to give an exposition of the Gnosticism that for
some of the earlier centuries agitated the Christian Church; it will
suffice for our purpose here to say that its manifold phases were
attempts to reach satisfactory conclusions on the great subjects of
man\'s relations to his Maker, to his fellowmen, to himself, and to the
universe --- to solve the problems of time and eternity. The Gnostic
philosophies in the church show the results of blending the Oriental,
the Jewish, and the Platonic philosophies with the new religion.
\"Gnosticism,[^186] was a philosophy of religion,\" and Christian
Gnosticism was an effort to explain the new revelation philosophically.
But there were Gnostics and Gnostics. Some of the Christian Fathers used
the term reproachfully, and others appropriated it as one of honor.
Gnosis, knowledge, philosophy applied to religion, was deemed
all-important by Clement, Origen, and the most prominent of the Fathers.
Mere Gnostics were only Pagan philosophers, but Christian Gnostics were
those who accepted Christ as the author of a new and divine revelation,
and interpreted it by those principles that had long antedated the
religion of Jesus.[^187] "The Gnostics were the first regular
commentators on the New Testament...The Gnostics were also the first
practitioners of the higher criticism...It (Gnosticism) may be regarded
as a half-way house, through which many Pagans, like Ambrosius or St.
Augustine, found their way into the church."[^188] The Valentinians,
Basilidians, Carpocratians, Manichaeans, Marcionites and others were
Christian Gnostics; but Clement, Origen and the great Alexandrians and
their associates were Gnostic Christians. In fact, the Gnostic theories
sought a solution of the problem of evil; to answer the question, \"Can
the world as we know it have been made by God?\" \"Cease,\" says
Basilides,[^189] \" from idle and curious variety, and let us rather
discuss the opinions which even barbarians have held on the subject of
good and evil...I will say anything rather than admit Providence is
wicked.\" Valentinus declared, "I dare not affirm that God is the author
of all this." Tertullian says that Marcion, like many men of our time,
and especially the heretics, \"is bewildered by the question of evil.\"
The generally accepted Gnostic view was that while the good would at
death ascend to dwell with the Father, the wicked would pass through
transformations until purified.

Says Prof. Allen: "Gnosticism is a genuine and legitimate outgrowth of
the same general movement of thought that shaped the Christian dogma.
Quite evidently it regarded itself as the true interpreter of the
Gospel."

Baur quotes a German writer as giving a full exposition of one of the
latest attempts "to bring back Gnosticism to a greater harmony with the
spirit of Christianity." Briefly, *sophia* (wisdom), as the type of
mankind, falls, rises, and is united to the eternal Good. Baur says that
Gnosticism declares that \"either through conversion and amendment, or
through utter annihilation, evil is to disappear, and the final goal of
the whole world process is to be reached, viz., the purification of the
universe from all that is unworthy and perverted.\"

Harnack says that Gnosticism "aimed at the winning of a world-religion.
The Gnostics were the theologians of the First Century; they were the
first to transform Christianity into a system of doctrines (dogmas).
They essayed...to conquer Christianity for Hellenic culture and Hellenic
culture for Christianity."[^190]

## Noteworthy Facts.

Differing from the so-called \"orthodox\" Christians on many points, the
three great Gnostic sects of the Second Century were in full agreement
with Clement and Origen and the Alexandrine school, and probably with
the great majority of Christians, in their views of human destiny. They
taught the ultimate holiness and happiness of the human family, and it
is noteworthy that though the Gnostics advocated the final salvation of
all souls, and though the orthodox fathers savagely attacked them on
many points, they never reckoned their Universalism as a fault. This
doctrine was not obnoxious to either orthodox or heterodox in the early
centuries.

# 8. The Sibylline Oracles.

The oldest Christian document since the New Testament, explicitly
avowing the doctrine of universal restoration, is the *Sibylline
Oracles*.[^191] Different portions of this composition were written at
different dates, from 181 BC to 267 AD. The portion expressing universal
salvation was written by an Alexandrine Christian, about 80 AD, and the
*Oracles* were in general circulation from 100 AD onward, and are
referred to with great consideration for many centuries subsequently.

## The Righteous Pray for the Wicked.

After describing the destruction of the world, which the Sibyl
prophesies, and the consignment of the wicked to *aionion* torment, such
as our Lord teaches in Matthew 25:46, the blessed inhabitants of heaven
are represented as being made wretched by the thought of the sufferings
of the lost, and as beseeching God with united voice to release them.
God accedes to their request and delivers them from their torment and
bestows happiness upon them. The \"Oracles\" declare: "The omnipotent,
incorruptible God shall confer another favor on his worshipers, when
they shall ask him. He shall save mankind from the pernicious fire and
immortal (*athanaton*) agonies...Having gathered them and safely secured
them from the unwearied flame...he shall send them, for his people\'s
sake, into another and *aeonian* life with the immortals on the Elysian
plain, where flow perpetually the long dark waves of the deep sea of
Acheron."[^192]

The punishments of the wicked are here described in the strongest
possible terms; they are "eternal," (*aionion*), "immortal"
(*athanaton*), and yet it is declared that at the request of the
righteous, God will deliver them from those torments.

The Sibyl anticipates the poet Whittier:

> \"Still thy love, O Christ arisen,\
> Yearns to reach those souls in prison;\
> Through all depths of sin and loss\
> Drops the plummet of thy cross;\
> Never yet abyss was found\
> Deeper than that cross could sound;\
> Deep below as high above\
> Sweeps the circle of God\'s love.\"

Holmes expresses the same sentiment:

> \"What if (a) spirit redeemed, amid the host\
> Of chanting angels, in some transient lull\
> Of the eternal anthem heard the cry\
> Of its lost darling. \* \* \*\
> Would it not long to leave the bliss of heaven\
> Bearing a little water in its hand,\
> To moisten those poor lips that plead in vain\
> With him we call Our Father?\"

This famous document was quoted by Athenagoras, Theophilus, Justin
Martyr, Lactantius, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius and
Augustine. **Clement** calls the author "the prophetess." As late as the
Middle Ages the \"Oracles\" was well known, and its author was ranked
with David. When **Thomas of Celano** composed the great Hymn of the
Judgment, he said:

> \"*Dies Irae, dies illa,\
> Solvet saeclum in favilla,\
> Teste David cum Sibylla,\"*

The best scholars concede the Universalism of the \"Oracles.\"

Says Musardus,[^193] the \"Oracles\" teach \"that the damned shall be
liberated after they shall have endured infernal punishments for many
ages...which was an error of Origen.\"

And Opsopoeus adds[^194] "that the 'Oracles' teach that the wicked
suffering in hell (Gehenna) after a certain period, and through
expiations of griefs, would be released from punishments, which was the
opinion of Origen," etc.

Hades, and all things and persons are cast into unquenchable fire for
purification; that is, the fire is unquenchable until it has
accomplished its purpose of purification. Gehenna itself, as Origen
afterwards insisted, purifies and surrenders its prisoners. The wicked
are to suffer \"immortal\" agonies and then be saved.

## The Oracles are Early Christian Classics.

Dr. Westcott remarks of the *Oracles*: "They stand alone as an attempt
to embrace all history, even in its details, in one great, theocratic
view, and to regard the kingdoms of the world as destined to form
provinces in a future Kingdom of God."

While the views of retribution are not elevated and represent the
punishment of the wicked as in literal fire, and not a moral discipline,
such as Origen taught, they clearly teach universal salvation beyond all
*aeonian*, even *athanaton* suffering. A noted writer[^195] declares:
\"The doctrine of Universalism is brought forward in more than one
passage of this piece;\" though elsewhere Dr. Deane misstates,
inconsistently enough, the language of the Sibyl, thus: \"God,
hearkening to the prayers of the saints, shall save some from the pains
of hell.\" He mistranslates *anthropois* into \"some\" instead of
\"mankind,\" the meaning of the word, in order to show that the Sibyl
"does not, like Origen, believe in universal salvation." And yet he is
forced to add: "This notion of the salvation of any is opposed to the
sentiment elsewhere expressed...where in picturing the torments of hell
the writer asserts that there is no place for repentance or any mercy or
hope." But Dr. Deane forgets that the acknowledged Universalists of the
early church employed equally strong terms concerning the duration of
punishment. The use of the terms signifying endless torment employed by
the Sibyl, as by Origen and others, did not preclude the idea of the
ultimate salvation of those thus punished. Origen taught that the most
stubborn sins will be \"extinguished\" by the \"eternal fire,\" just as
the Sibyl says the wicked perish in \"immortal\" fire and are
subsequently saved.

## Sir John Floyer's Blunder.

In line with Deane\'s strange contradictions may be mentioned another of
the many curiosities of criticism. An English prose version of the
Sibyl\'s Homeric hexameters was made in 1713 by Sir John Floyer.[^196]
He denies that the \"Oracles\" teach universal salvation at all, but in
order to sustain his position he omits to translate one word and
mistranslates another! He renders the entire passage thus: \"The
Almighty and incorruptible God shall grant this also to the righteous
when they shall pray to him; that he will preserve them (literally save
mankind, *anthropois sosai*) from the pernicious fire and everlasting
gnashing of teeth; and this will he do when he gathers the faithful from
the eternal fire, placing them in another region, he shall send them by
his own angels into another life, which will be eternal to them that are
immortal, in the Elysian fields," etc.

It is only by rendering the words denoting \"save mankind,\" \"deliver
them,\" that he makes his point. A correct rendering coincides with the
declarations of most scholars that universal salvation is taught in this
unique document.

The Sibyl declares that the just and the unjust pass through
\"unquenchable fire,\" and that all things, even Hades, are to be
purified by the divine fire. And after the unjust have been released
from Hades, they are committed to Gehenna, and then at the desire of the
righteous, they are to be removed thence to \"a life eternal for
immortals.\"[^197]

Augustine[^198] cited the famous acrostic on the Savior\'s name as a
proof that the Sibyl foretold the coming of Jesus. And it is curious to
note that in his *City of God*, when stating that certain \"merciful
doctors\" denied the eternity of punishment, he gives the same reasons
they assign for their belief that the Sibyl names. He quotes the
\"merciful doctors\" as saying that Christians in this world possess the
disposition to forgive their enemies that they will not lay aside those
traits at death, but will pity, forgive, and pray for the wicked. The
redeemed will unite in this prayer and will not God feel pity, and
answer the prayer in which all the saved unite? Augustine presents these
unanswerable objections and devotes many pages to a very feeble reply to
them.

So fully did the Christians of the First Century recognize the
*Oracles*, and appeal to them, that they were frequently styled the
Sibylists. Celsus applied the word to them, and Origen, though he
accepted the Sibyl\'s teachings concerning destiny, objected that the
term was not justly applied. This he does in *Against Celsius* V. 61.

Clement of Alexandria not only calls the Sibyl a prophetess, but her
*Oracles* a saving hymn.

Lactantius cited fifty passages from the Sibyl in his evidences of
Christianity.

No book, not even the New Testament, exerted a wider influence on the
first centuries of the church, than the *Sibylline Oracles*.

Quite a literature of the subject exists in the periodical publications
of the past few years, but there are very few references to the
Universalism of the *Oracles*. The *Edinburgh Review* (July, 1867) is an
exception. It states that the *Oracles* declare \"the Origenist belief
of a universal restoration (V. 33) of all men, even to the unjust, and
the devils themselves.\" The *Oracles* are especially valuable in
showing the opinions of the first Christians after the apostles, and, as
they aim to convert Pagans to Christ, and employ this doctrine as one of
the weapons, it must at that time have been considered a prominent
Christian tenet, and the candid student is forced to conclude that they
give expression to the prevalent opinion of those days on the subject of
human destiny.

The reader must not fail to observe that the *Sibylline Oracles*
explicitly state the deliverance of the damned from the torments of
hell. They repeatedly call the suffering everlasting, even \"immortal,\"
yet declare that it shall end in the restoration of the lost.

# 9. Pantaenus and Clement. 

## Pantaenus, the "Sicilian Bee."

There is nothing known to exist from the pen of Pantaenus, but we learn
from Eusebius that this distinguished scholar and teacher was at the
head of the Catechetical school in Alexandria as early as 179 AD, having
succeeded Anaxagoras. This celebrated institution had been in existence
since 100-120 AD. Tradition asserts that it was founded by the
apostles.[^199] Jerome says, \"*a Marco Evangelista semper ecclesiastici
fuere doctores*.\" It had been up to the time of Pantaenus a school for
proselytes, but he made it a theological seminary, and so was the real
founder of the Catechetical institution.[^200]

Pantaenus was a convert from Stoicism, and is described by Clement,
Jerome, and others as a man of superior learning and abilities. Clement
calls him \"that Sicilian bee gathering the spoil of the flowers of the
prophetic and apostolic meadow;\" \"the deepest Gnostic,\" by which he
means \"the deepest philosophical Christian, the man who best understood
and practiced Scripture.\" It could not be otherwise than that the
teacher of Clement cherished the religious views with which his great
disciple was graduated, for of Pantaenus, Clement says: \"I know what is
the weakness of these reflections, if I compare them with the gifted and
gracious teaching I was privileged to hear.\" Some of his writings are
alluded to, but though nothing remains, yet in Clement, who was inspired
by him, he gave to the church a priceless legacy.

In 189 AD Pantaenus went on a missionary tour to India, and Eusebius
says that while there he found the seeds of the Christian faith that had
been sown by previous missionaries, and that he brought home with him
the Gospel of Matthew, in Hebrew, that had been carried to India by
Bartholomew. May it not be that some of the precepts of Buddhism
resembling those of Christ, which the best Oriental scholars admit are
of later origin than Buddha, were caught from the teachings of early
Christian missionaries? Pantaenus was martyred 216 AD.

The Universalism of Clement, Origen and their successors must, beyond
question, have been taught by their great predecessor, Pantaenus, and
there is every reason to believe that the Alexandrine school had never
known any contrary teaching, from its foundation.

## The Famous Alexandrine School. 

At this time Alexandria was the second city in the world, with a
population of 600,000; its great library contained from 400,000 to
700,000 volumes; at one time 14,000 students are said to have been
assembled; and it was the center of the world\'s learning, culture,
thought; the seekers for truth and knowledge from all climes sought
inspiration at its shrines, and it was most of all in its interest to
us, not only the radiating center of Christian influence, but its
teachers and school made universal salvation the theme of Christian
teaching.

\"To those old Christians a being who was not seeking after every single
creature, and trying to raise him, could not be a being of absolute
righteousness, power, love; could not be a being worthy of respect or
admiration, even of philosophic speculation. The Alexandrian Christians
expounded and corroborated Christianity, and adapted it to all classes
and conditions of men, and made the best, perhaps the only, attempt yet
made by man to proclaim a true world-philosophy...embracing the whole
phenomena of humanity, capable of being understood and appreciated by
every human being from the highest to the lowest.\" The result was,
"they were enabled to produce, in the lives of millions, generation
after generation, a more immense moral improvement than the world had
ever seen before. Their disciples did actually become righteous and good
men, just in proportion as they were true to the lessons they learnt.
They did for centuries work a distinct and palpable deliverance on the
earth."[^201]

Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great, 332 BC, and it speedily
became a great city. After two centuries, however, it declined, until 30
BC when Augustus made it an imperial city. In 196 AD its municipality,
which had been lost for two centuries, was restored; from this time on
it resumed its old prosperity, which continued until internal
dissensions weakened it, and in 640 AD, after a siege of fourteen
months, it was taken by the Arabs under Amru, and among other disasters
the great library was destroyed. This library contained the precious
manuscripts of Origen and multitudes of others that might shed great
light on our theme. Abulpharagius relates that John the Grammarian, a
famous peripatetic philosopher, begged Amru to give him the library.
Amru forwarded the request to Omar, who replied that if the books
contained the same doctrines as the Koran they were not needed; if
contrary to it they ought not to be preserved, and they were therefore
ordered to be burnt. Accordingly they were distributed among the 4,000
public baths of the city, where they furnished the fuel for six months!

Alexandria continued to decline until the discovery of the route to the
East in 1497 ruined its commerce, and it sank to a population of 6,000.
But the opening of the Mahmoudieh canal in 1820 has increased its
prosperity, and it is now one of the most important cities of the world.
In 1871 it had a population of 219,602. At the time of Christ, and for
two hundred years after, Alexandria was at the height of its greatness.
From the time of Ptolemy Soter (306-285 BC), the books, scholars and
learning of the world were centered in this great city. The religions
and philosophies of the world met here and created an intense life of
thought. Jews, Christians, Pagans were gathered and met in intellectual
conflict as nowhere else. It was here that Clement, Origen, and their
followers exerted their best influence, and that Christianity preserved
its purity for centuries.

\"The north of Africa was then crowded with rich and populous cities,
and formed with Egypt the granary of the world...In no part of the
empire had Christianity taken more deep and permanent root...Africa,
rather than Rome, was the parent of Latin Christianity. Tertullian was
at this period the chief representative of African Christianity...still
later Cyprian, and later still Augustine. To us, preoccupied with the
modern insignificance of the Egyptian town, it requires an effort of the
mind to realize that Alexandria was once the second largest city in the
world, and the second greatest patriarchate of the church, the church of
Clement, Origen, Athanasius and Cyril. It gives us a kind of mental
shock when we recall that the land of Tertullian, Cyprian and Augustine
is the modem Tunis and Algiers.\"

## Alexandria the Christian Metropolis.

\"The seat and center of Christianity during the first three centuries
was Alexandria. West of Alexandria the influence of the Latins,
Tertullian, Cyprian, Minucius Felix and Augustine prevailed, and their
type of Christianity was warped and developed by the influence of Roman
law. Maine says that in going from East to West theological speculation
passed from Greek metaphysics to Roman law. The genius of Augustine,
thus controlled, gave rise to Calvinism. The gloomy and precise
Tertullian, the vigorous and austere Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, and
Augustine, the gloomiest and most materialistic of theologians, who may
almost be said to have invented the hell of the Middle Ages, contributed
the forces that later adulterated the genuine Christian faith. Even yet
the Greek population of the Eastern church, who read the Greek Gospels
as we read the English, are like the Greek fathers of the first ages of
the church; they know nothing of the doctrine invented by the Latin
theologians.\"[^202]

\"In such a city as Alexandria --- with its museum, its libraries, its
lectures, its schools of philosophy, its splendid synagogue, its avowed
atheists, its deep-thinking Oriental mystics --- the Gospel would have
been powerless if it had been unable to produce teachers who were
capable of meeting Pagan philosophers and Jewish Philoists on their own
ground. Such thinkers would refuse their attention to men who could not
understand their reasonings, sympathize with their perplexities, refute
their fundamental arguments, and meet them in the spirit of Christian
courtesy.[^203] Different instruments are needed for different ends.
Where Clement of Rome might have been useless, Clement of Alexandria
became deeply influential. Where a Tertullian would only have aroused
contempt and indignation, an Origen won leading Pagans to the faith of
Christ. From Alexandria came the refutation of Celsus; from Alexandria
the defeat of Arius. It was the cradle of Christian theology.[^204]

\"There can be no doubt that the wonderful advance of Christianity among
the cultivated, during the First and Second Centuries, was made by the
remarkable men who founded and maintained the Alexandrian school of
Christian thought. While the common people heard gladly the simple story
of the Gospel, the world\'s scholars were attracted and won by the
consummate learning and genius of Clement and Origen, and their
coadjutors.\"

"Pagan thinkers would have paid attention to Clement when he spoke of
Plato as truly noble and half-inspired; they would have looked on the
African father as an ignorant railer, who had nothing better to say of
Socrates than that he was \'the Attic buffoon,\' of Aristotle than
'*miseriun Aristotelem*!' Such arguments as Tertullian\'s It is credible
because it is absurd, it is certain because it is impossible, would have
been regarded as worse than useless in reasoning with philosophers."

The Alexandrine Universalists met philosophers and scholars on their own
ground and conquered them with their own weapons. Under God, the agency
that gave Christianity it's standing and wonderful progress during the
first three centuries, was the Catechetical school of Alexandria, and
the saintly scholars and Christian philosophers who immortalized the
famous city that was the scene of their labors. They met and surpassed
the apostles of culture and proved at the very beginning that
Christianity is no less the religion of the wise and learned than of the
unlettered and simple. The Universalist Church has never sufficiently
recalled and celebrated the great labors and marvelous successes of
their progenitors in the primitive years of Christianity.

## The Alexandrine Teachers.

\"Those who are truly called the fathers and founders of the Christian
church were not the simple-minded fishermen of Galilee, but men who had
received the highest education which could be obtained at the time, that
is Greek education....In Alexandria, at that time the very center of the
world, it had either to vanquish the world or to vanish....Christianity
came no doubt from the small room in the house of Mary, where many were
gathered together praying, but as early as the Second Century it became
a very different Christianity in the Catechetical school of
Alexandria...What Clement had most at heart was not the letter but the
spirit, not the historical events, but their deeper meaning in universal
history.\"[^205]

## Max Muller's Words.

Muller points out the fact that the Alexandrine "current of Christian
thought was never entirely lost, but rose to the surface again and again
at the most critical periods in the history of the Christian religion.
Unchecked by the Council of Nicaea, AD 325, that ancient stream of
philosophical and religious thought flows on, and we can hear the
distant echoes of Alexandria in the writings of St. Basil (AD 329-379),
Gregory of Nyssa (AD 332-395), Gregory of Nazianzus (AD 328-389), as
well as in the works of St. Augustine (AD 364-430)."

The reader of the history of those times cannot help deploring the
subsequent substitution of Latin Augustinianism and its long train of
errors and evils for Greek Alexandrianism, nor can the Christian student
avoid wishing that the Alexandrine Christians could have been permitted
to transmit their beneficent principles uncorrupted. How different would
have been the Middle Ages! How far beyond its present condition would be
the Christendom of today!

## Clement of Alexandria. 

Titus Flavius Clemens, Clemens Alexandrinus, or Clement of Alexandria
--- born 150 AD, died AD 220 --- was reared in heathenism. Before his
conversion to Christianity he had been thoroughly educated in Hellenic
literature and philosophy. It is uncertain whether he was born in Athens
or Alexandria. He became a Christian early in his adult years; was
presbyter in the church in Alexandria, and in 189 he succeeded Pantaenus
as president of the celebrated Catechetical school in Alexandria. During
the persecution by Septimius Severus in 202 he fled and was in Jerusalem
in 211. He never returned to Alexandria but died about 220. This is all
that is known of his life.

He was the father of the Alexandrine Christian Philosophy, or ancient
Philosophical Christianity. Many of his works have perished; the
principal ones that survive are his *Exhortation to the Heathen*, the
*Teacher*, or *Pedagogue*, and *Stromata*, or *Miscellanies*, literally
*Tapestries*, or freely translated *Carpet Bag*.[^206]

It is the verdict of scholars that Clement\'s *Stromata* is the greatest
of all the Christian apologies except Origen\'s. It starts \"from the
essential affinity between man and God, (and) goes on to show how, in
Christianity, we have the complete restoration of the normal relation
between the creature and the Creator.\"

The influence of the Greek philosophers, and especially of Plato, on the
Alexandrine fathers, is conceded.[^207] Clement held that the true
Gnostic was the perfect Christian. The Alexandrine fathers had no
hostility to the word Gnostic, properly understood; to them it signified
the Christian who brings reason and philosophy to bear on his faith, in
contradistinction from the ignorant believer. Irenaeus had declared
\"genuine gnosis,\" or Gnosticism, to be \"the doctrine of the
apostles,\" insisting on \"the plenary use of Scripture, admitting
neither addition nor curtailment, and the reading of Scripture, and
legitimate and diligent preaching, according to the word of God.\" And
Justin had bequeathed to the Alexandrine school the central truth that
the Divine Word is in the germ in every human being. This great fact was
never lost sight of but was more and more developed by the three great
teachers --- Pantaenus, Clement and Origen.

### Clement's Philosophy.

The materialistic philosophy of Epicureanism, that happiness is the
highest good and can best be procured in a well-regulated enjoyment of
the pleasures of life; the Pantheistic system of Stoicism, that one
should live within himself, superior to the accidents of time; the
logical Aristotelianism, and the Platonism that regarded the universe as
the work of a Supreme Spirit, in which man is a permanent individuality
possessing a spark of the divinity that would ultimately purify him and
elevate him to a higher life; and that virtue would accelerate and sin
retard his upward progress --- these different systems all had their
votaries, but the noblest of all, the Platonic, was most influential
with the Alexandrine fathers, though, like Clement, they exercised a
wise and rational eclecticism, in adopting the best features of each
system. This Clement claimed to do. He says: \"And by philosophy I mean
not the Stoic, nor the Platonic, nor the Epicurean, nor that of
Aristotle; but whatever any of these sects had said that was fit and
just, that taught righteousness with a divine and religious knowledge,
this I call eclectic philosophy.\"[^208]

Matters of speculation he solved by philosophy, but his theology he
derived from the Scriptures. He was not, therefore, a mere philosopher,
but one who used philosophy as a help to the interpretation of the
religion of Christ. He says; \"We wait for no human testimony, but bring
proof of what we assert from the Word of the Lord, which is the most
trustworthy, or, rather, the only evidence.\"

The thoroughly Greek mind of Clement, with his great imagination, vast
learning and research, splendid ability, and divine spirit, could
scarcely misinterpret or misunderstand the New Testament Scriptures,
written as they were in his mother tongue, and it is not difficult to
believe with Bunsen, that in this seat and center of Christian culture
and Christian learning, he became "the first Christian philosopher of
the history of mankind. He believed in a universal plan of a divine
education of the human race....This is the grand position occupied by
Clemens, the Alexandrian, in the history of the church and of mankind
and the key to his doctrine about God and his word, Christ and his
spirit, God and man....A profound respect for the piety and holiness of
Clemens is as universal in the ancient church as for his learning and
eloquence. I rejoice to find that Reinkins, a Roman Catholic, expresses
his regret, not to say indignation, that this holy man and writer, the
object of the unmixed admiration of the ancient Christian, should have
been struck out of the catalogue of saints by Benedict XIV.\"[^209]

### A Transition Period.

When Clement, wrote Christian doctrine was passing from oral tradition
to written definition, and he avers when setting forth the Christian
religion, that he is \"reproducing an original unwritten tradition,\"
which he learned from a disciple of the apostles. This had been
communicated by the Lord to the apostles, Peter and James and John and
Paul, and handed down from father to son till, at length, Clement set
forth accurately in writing, what had been before delivered orally. We
can, therefore, scarcely hope to find unadulterated Christianity
anywhere out of the New Testament, if not in the writings of Clement.

Max Muller[^210] declares that Clement, having been born in the middle
of the Second Century, may possibly have known Papias, or some of his
friends who knew the apostles, and therefore he was most competent to
represent the teachings of Christ.

Farrar writes: \"There can be no doubt that after the date of the
Clementine Recognitions, and unceasingly during the close of the third
and during the fourth and following centuries, the abstract idea of
endlessness was deliberately faced, and from imperfect acquaintance with
the meaning and history of the word *aionios* it was used by many
writers as though it were identical in meaning with *aidios* or
endless.\" Which is to say that ignorance of the real meaning of the
word on the part of those who were not familiar with Greek, subverted
the current belief in universal restoration, cherished, as we shall
directly show, by Clement and the Alexandrine Christians.

### Clement's Language.

Passages from the works of Clement, only a few of which we quote, will
sufficiently establish the fact that he taught universal restoration.

"For all things are ordered both universally and in particular by the
Lord of the universe, with a view to the salvation of the universe....
But needful corrections, by the goodness of the great, overseeing judge,
through the attendant angels, through various prior judgments, through
the final judgment, compel even those who have become more callous to
repent."

"So he saves all; but some he converts by penalties, others who follow
him of their own will, and in accordance with the worthiness of his
honor, that every knee may be bent to him of celestial, terrestrial and
infernal things (Phil. 2:10), that is angels, men, and souls who before
his advent migrated from this mortal life."

"For there are partial corrections (*padeiai*) which are called
chastisements (*kolaseis*), which many of us who have been in
transgression incur by falling away from the Lord\'s people. But as
children are chastised by their teacher, or their father, so are we by
Providence. But God does not punish (*timoriaita*), for punishment
(*timoria*) is retaliation for evil. He chastises, however, for good to
those who are chastised collectively and individually."[^211]

This important passage is very instructive in the light it sheds on the
usage of Greek words. The word from which \"corrections\" is rendered is
the same as that in Hebrews 12:9, \"correction\" \"chastening\"
(*paideia*); \"chastisement\" is from *kolasis*, translated punishment
in Matthew 25:46, and \"punishment\" is *timoria*, with which Josephus
defines punishment, but a word our Lord never employs, and which Clement
declares that God never inflicts. This agrees with the uniform
contention of Universalist scholars.

\"The divine nature is not angry but is at the farthest from it, for it
is an excellent artifice to frighten in order that we may not sin....
Nothing is hated by God.\'\'[^212] So that even if *aionios* meant
endless duration, Clement would argue that it was used pedagogically ---
to restrain the sinner. It should be said, however, that Clement rarely
uses *aionion* in connection with suffering.

**Clement** insists that punishment in Hades is remedial and
restorative, and that punished souls are cleansed by fire. The fire is
spiritual, purifying[^213] the soul. "God\'s punishments are saving and
disciplinary (in Hades) leading to conversion, and choosing rather the
repentance than the death of the sinner, (Ezek. 18:23, 32; 33:11, etc.,)
and especially since souls, although darkened by passions, when released
from their bodies, are able to perceive more clearly because of their
being no longer obstructed by the paltry flesh."[^214]

He again defines the important word *kolasis* our Lord uses in Matthew
25:46, and shows how it differs from the wholly different word *timoria*
used by **Josephus** and the Greek writers who believed in irremediable
suffering.

He says: \"He (God) chastises the disobedient, for chastisement
(*kolasis*) is for the good and advantage of him who is punished, for it
is the amendment of one who resists; I will not grant that he wishes to
take vengeance. Vengeance (*timoria*) is a requital of evil sent for the
interest of the avenger. He (God) would not desire to avenge himself on
us who teaches us to pray for those who despitefully use us (Matt.
5:44).[^215]...Therefore the good God punishes for these three causes:
First, that he who is punished (*paidenomenos*) may become better than
his former self; then that those who are capable of being saved by
examples may be drawn back, being admonished; and thirdly, that he who
is injured may not readily be despised, and be apt to receive injury.
And there are two methods of correction, the instructive and the
punitive,[^216] which we have called the disciplinary.\"

The English reader of the translations of the Greek fathers is misled by
the indiscriminate rendering of different Greek words into \"punish.\"
*Timoria* should always be translated "vengeance," or \"torment;\"
*kolasis*, \"punishment,\" and *paideia* \"chastisement,\" or
\"correction.\"

\"If in this life there are so many ways for purification and
repentance, how much more should there be after death! The purification
of souls, when separated from the body, will be easier. We can set no
limits to the agency of the Redeemer; to redeem, to rescue, to
discipline, is his work, and so will he continue to operate after this
life.\"[^217]

Clement did not deem it well to express himself more fully and
frequently respecting this point of doctrine, because he considered it a
part of the Gnostic or esoteric knowledge which it might not be well for
the unenlightened to hear lest it should result in the injury of the
ignorant; hence he says: \"As to the rest I am silent and praise the
Lord.\" He \"fears to set down in writing what he would not venture to
read aloud.\" He thinks this knowledge not useful for all, and that the
fear of hell may keep sinners from sin. And yet he cannot resist
declaring: \"And how is he Savior and Lord and not Savior and Lord of
all? But he (Christ) is the Savior of those who have believed, because
of their wishing to know, and of those who have not believed he is Lord,
until by being brought to confess him they shall receive the proper and
well-adapted blessing for themselves which comes by him.\"

This extension of the day of grace through eternity is also expressed in
the *Exhortation to the Heathen* (ix): \"For great is the grace of his
promise, 'if today we hear his voice.' And that today is lengthened out
day by day, while it is called today. And to the end the today and the
instruction continue; and then the true today, the never ending day of
God, extends over eternity.\"

His reference to the resurrection shows that he regarded it as
deliverance from the ills of this state of being. Before the final state
of perfection the purifying fire which makes wise will separate errors
from the soul; the purgating punishment will heal and cure.

Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem, wrote to Origen on the death of Clement,
says Eusebius, \"for we know these blessed fathers who have gone before
us and with whom we shall shortly be, I mean Pantaenus, truly blessed
and my master; and the sacred Clement, who was my master and profitable
to me.\"

This passage would indicate the fraternity of feeling between these
three and seems to show that there was no suspicion of the heresy of the
others on the part of Alexander.

### Further Words of Clement.

Clement distinctly shows that the perversion of the truth so long
taught, that the coming of Christ placated the Father, had no place in
primitive Christianity. He says: "God is good on his own account, and
just also on ours, and he is just because he is good...for before he
became Creator he was God. He was good. And therefore he wished to be
Creator and Father. And the nature of that love was the source of
righteousness; the cause too of his lighting up his sun, and sending
down his own son....The feeling of anger (if it is proper to call his
admonition anger) is full of love to man, God condescending to emotion
on man\'s account, etc."[^218]

He represents that God is never angry; he hates sin with unlimited
hatred but loves the sinner with illimitable love. His omnipotence is
directed by omniscience and can and will overcome all evil and transform
it to good. His threats and punishments have but one purpose, and that
the good of the punished. Hereafter those who have here remained
obdurate will be chastened until converted. Man\'s freedom will never be
lost, and ultimately it will be converted in the last and wickedest
sinner.

Fire is an emblem of the divine punishments which purify the bad.[^219]
\"Punishment is, in its operation, like medicine; it dissolves the hard
heart, purges away the filth of uncleanness, and reduces the swellings
of pride and haughtiness; thus restoring its subject to a sound and
healthful state.\"

"The Lord is the propitiation, not only for our sins, that is of the
faithful, but also for the whole world (1 John 2:2); therefore he truly
saves all, converting some by punishments, and others by gaining their
free will, so that he has the high honor that unto him every knee should
bow, angels, men and the souls of those who died before his advent."
That the foregoing passages from Clement distinctly state the sublime
sentiments we have supposed them to express, will fully appear from
those who have made the most careful study of his opinions, and whose
interpretations are unprejudiced and just. Says one of the most
thoughtful of modern writers, the candid Hagenbach:

\"The works of Clement, in particular, abound with passages referring to
the love and mercy of God. He loves men because they are kindred with
God. God\'s love follows men, seeks them out, as the bird the young that
has fallen from its nest.\"[^220]

Clement, like Tertullian, denied original depravity, and held that "man
now stands in the same relation to the tempter in which Adam stood
before the Fall." Clement\'s doctrine of the Resurrection was like that
of Paul; it is not a mere rising from death, but a standing up higher,
in a greater fullness of life, and a better life, as the word
*anastasis* properly signifies.

### Allen's Statement.

Allen in his valuable work, *Continuity of Christian Thought*,
epitomizes the teachings of Clement in language that describes the
Universalistic contention. "The judgment is not conceived as the final
assize of the universe in some remote future, but as a present,
continuous element in the process of human education. The purpose of the
judgment, as of all the divine penalties, is always remedial. Judgment
enters into the work of redemption as a constructive factor. God does
not teach in order that he may finally judge, but he judges in order
that he may teach. The censures, the punishments, the judgments of God
are a necessary element of the educational process in the life of
humanity, and the motive which underlies them is goodness and
love....The idea of life as an education under the immediate
superintendence of a Divine instructor who is God himself indwelling in
the world, constitutes the central truth in Clement\'s theology....There
is no necessity that God should be reconciled with humanity, for there
is no schism in the divine nature between love and justice which needs
to be overcome before love can go forth in free and full forgiveness.
The idea that justice and love are distinct attributes of God, differing
widely in their operation, is regarded by Clement as having its origin
in a mistaken conception of their nature. Justice and love are in
reality the same attribute, or, to speak from the point of view which
distinguishes them, God is most loving when he is most just, and most
just when he is most loving....God works all things up to what is
better. Clement would not tolerate the thought that any soul would
continue forever to resist the force of redeeming love. Somehow and
somewhere in the long run of ages, that love must prove weightier than
sin and death, and vindicate its power in one universal triumph.\"

### Bigg on Clement.

One of the best modern statements of the views of the Alexandrine
fathers is given by Bigg[^221]: Clement regarded the object of *kolasis*
as \"threefold; amendment, example, and protection of the weak. Strom.
1:26, 168; 4:24, 154; 6:12, 99. The distinction between *kolasis* and
*timoria*, Strom. 4:14, 153; Paed. 1:8, 70, the latter is the rendering
of evil for evil and this is not the desire of God. Both *kolasis* and
*timoria* are spoken of in Strom. 5:14, 90, but this is not to be
pressed, for in Strom. 6:14, 109, the distinction between the words is
dropped and both signify purgatorial chastisement.... Fear he has
handled in the truly Christian spirit. It is not the fear of the slave
who hates his master; it is the reverence of a child for its father, of
a citizen for the good magistrate. Tertullian, an African and a lawyer,
dwells with fierce satisfaction on terrible visions of torment. The
cultivated Greek shrinks not only from the gross materialism of such a
picture, but from the idea of retribution which it implies. He is never
tired of repeating that justice is but another name for mercy.
Chastisement is not to be dreaded but to be embraced.\"... Here or
hereafter God\'s desire is not vengeance but correction. Though
Clement\'s view of man\'s destiny is called restorationism
(*apokatastasis*) it was "not as the restitution of that which was lost
at the Fall, but as the crown and consummation of the destiny of man
leading to a righteousness such as Adam never knew, and to heights of
glory and power as yet unsealed and undreamed....His books are in many
ways the most valuable monument of the early church; the more precious
to all intelligent students because he lived, not like Origen, in the
full stream of events, but in a quiet backwater where primitive thoughts
and habits lingered longer than elsewhere." "Clement had no enemies in
life or in death." The great effort of Clement and Origen seems to have
been to reconcile the revelation of God in Christ with the older
revelation of God in nature.

Says De Pressense: \"That which strikes us in Clement is his serenity.
We feel that he himself enjoys that deep and abiding peace which he
urges the Corinthians to seek. It is impressed on every page he writes,
while his thoughts flow on like a broad and quiet stream, never swelling
into a full impetuous tide.... We feel that this man has a great love
for Jesus Christ.\" Compare, contrast rather, his serenity and
peacefulness with the stormy tempestuousness of Tertullian, his \"narrow
and passionate realism,\" and we see a demonstration of the power and
beauty of the Restorationist faith.

### Frederick Denison Maurice's Eulogy.

Frederick Denison Maurice declares:[^222] \"I do not know where we shall
look for a purer or a truer man than this Clemens of Alexandria.... He
seems to me that one, of the old fathers whom we should all have
reverenced most as a teacher, and loved best as a friend.\"

Baur remarks: "Alexandria, the birthplace of Gnosticism, is also the
birthplace of Christian theology, which in fact in its earliest forms,
aimed at being nothing but a Christian Gnosticism. Among the fathers,
Clement of Alexandria and Origen stand nearest to the Gnostics. They
rank *gnosis* (knowledge) above *pistis* (faith), and place the two in
such an immanent relation to one another that neither can exist without
the other. Thus they adopt the same point of view as the Gnostics. It is
their aim, by drawing into their service all that the philosophy of the
age could contribute, to interpret Christianity in its historical
connection, and to take up its subject-matter into their thinking
consciousness.\"[^223]

A candid historian observes: \"Clemens may, perhaps, be esteemed the
most profoundly learned of the fathers of the church. A keen desire for
information had prompted him to explore the regions of universal
knowledge, to dive into the mysteries of Paganism, and to dwell upon the
abstruser doctrines of Holy Writ. His works are richly stored and
variegated with illustrations and extracts from the poets and
philosophers with whose sentiments he was familiarly acquainted. He lays
open the curiosities of history, the secrets of motley superstitions,
and the reveries of speculative wanderers, at the same time that he
develops the cast of opinions and peculiarities of discipline which
distinguished the members of the Christian state.\"[^224]

*Daille* writes: "It is manifest throughout his works that Clement
thought all the punishments that God inflicts upon men are salutary. Of
this kind he reckons the torments which the damned in hell suffer....
Clemens was of the same opinion as his scholar Origen, who everywhere
teaches that all the punishments of those in hell are purgatorial, that
they are not endless, but will at length cease when the damned are
sufficiently purified by the fire."[^225]

Farrar gives Clement\'s views, and shows that the great Alexandrian
really anticipated substantially the thought for which our church has
contended for a century:

\"There are very few of the Christian fathers whose fundamental
conceptions are better suited to correct the narrowness, the rigidity
and the formalism of Latin theology.... It is his lofty and wholesome
doctrine that man is made in the image of God; that man\'s will is free;
that he is redeemed from sin by a divine education and a corrective
discipline; that fear and punishment are but remedial instruments in
man\'s training; that Justice is but another aspect of perfect Love;
that the physical world is good and not evil; that Christ is a Living
not a Dead Christ; that all mankind form one great brotherhood in him;
that salvation is an ethical process, not an external reward; that the
atonement was not the pacification of wrath, but the revelation of
God\'s eternal mercy.... That judgment is a continuous process, not a
single sentence; that God works all things up to what is better; that
souls may be purified beyond the grave.\"

Lamson says that Clement declares: \"Punishment, as Plato taught, is
remedial, and souls are benefited by it by being amended. Far from being
incompatible with God\'s goodness it is a striking proof of it. For
punishment is for the good and benefit of him who is punished. It is the
bringing back to rectitude of that which has swerved from it.\"[^226]

It may be stated that neither original sin, depravity, infant guilt and
damnation, election, vicarious atonement, and endless punishment as the
penalty of human sin, in fact, \"none of the individual doctrines or
tenets which have so long been the object of dislike and animadversion
to the modern theological mind formed any constituent part in Greek
theology.\"[^227] They were abhorrent to Clement, Origen, and their
associates.

The views held by Clement and taught by his predecessor, Pantaenus, and,
as seems apparent, by Anathegoras and his predecessors back to the
apostles themselves, and by their successor Origen, and, as will appear
on subsequent pages by others down to Didymus, (395 AD), the last
president of the greatest theological school of the Second and Third
Centuries, were substantially those taught by the Universalist church of
today, so far as they included the character of God, the nature and
final destiny of mankind, the effect of the resurrection, the judgment,
the nature and end of punishment, and other cognate themes. In fact,
Clement stands on the subject of God\'s purpose and plan, and man\'s
ultimate destiny, as substantially a representative of the Universalist
church of the Nineteenth Century, as well as a type of ancient
scholarship.

# 10. Origen. 

Origen Adamantius was born of Christian parents, in Alexandria, 185 AD.
He was early taught the Christian religion, and when a mere boy could
recite long passages of Scripture from memory. During the persecution by
Septimus Severus, 202 AD, his father, Leonides, was imprisoned, and the
son wrote to him not to deny Christ out of tenderness for his family,
and was only prevented from surrendering himself to voluntary martyrdom
by his mother, who secreted his clothes. Leonides died a martyr.

In the year 203, then but eighteen years of age, Origen was appointed to
the presidency of the theological school in Alexandria, a position left
vacant by the flight of Clement from heathen persecution. He made
himself proficient in the various branches of learning, traveled in the
Orient and acquired the Hebrew language for the purpose of translating
the Scriptures. His fame extended in all directions. He won eminent
heathens to Christianity, and his instructions were sought by people of
all lands. He renounced all but the barest necessities of life, rarely
eating flesh, never drinking wine, slept on the naked floor, and devoted
the greater part of the night to prayer and study. Eusebius says that he
would not live upon the bounty of those who would have been glad to
maintain him while he was at work for the world\'s good, and so he
disposed of his valuable library to one who would allow him the daily
pittance of four obols; and rigidly acted on our Lord\'s precept not to
have "two coats, or wear shoes, and to have no anxiety for the
morrow."[^228] Origen is even said to have mutilated himself (though
this is disputed) from an erroneous construction of the Savior\'s
command (Matthew 19:12), and to guard himself from calumny that might
proceed from his association with female catechumens. This act he
lamented in later years. If done it was from the purest motives, and was
an act of great self-sacrifice, for, as it was forbidden by canonical
law, it debarred him from clerical promotion.

## Early Opposition to Origen.

He was ordained presbyter in 228 AD, by two bishops outside his diocese,
and this irregular act performed by others than his own diocesan gave
grounds to Demetrius of Alexandria, in whose jurisdiction he lived, to
manifest the envy he had already felt at the growing reputation of the
young scholar; and in two councils composed and controlled by Demetrius,
231 and 232 AD, Origen was deposed.[^229] Many of the church authorities
condemned the action. In this persecution Origen proved himself as grand
in spirit as in mind. To his friends he said: \"We must pity them rather
than hate them (his enemies), pray for them rather than curse them, for
we were made for blessing, not for cursing.\" Origen went to Palestine
in 230 AD, opened a school in Caesarea, and enjoyed a continually
increasing fame. The persecutions under Maximinus in 235, drove him
away. He went to Cappadocia, then to Greece, and finally back to
Palestine. Defamed at home he was honored abroad, but was at length
called back to Alexandria, where his pupil Dionysius had succeeded
Demetrius as bishop. But soon after, during the persecution under
Decius, he was tortured and condemned to die at the stake, but he
lingered, and at length died of his injuries and sufferings, a true
martyr, in Tyre, 253 or 254 AD, at the age of sixty-nine. His grave was
known down to the Middle Ages.

## Schaff on Origen.

The historian Schaff declares: \"It is impossible to deny a respectful
sympathy to this extraordinary man, who, with all his brilliant talents,
and a host of enthusiastic friends and admirers, was driven from his
country, stripped of his sacred office, excommunicated from a part of
the church, then thrown into a dungeon, loaded with chains, racked by
torture, doomed to drag his aged frame and dislocated limbs in pain and
poverty, and long after his death to have his memory branded, his name
anathematized, and his salvation denied; but who, nevertheless, did more
than all his enemies combined to advance the cause of sacred learning,
to refute and convert heathens and heretics, and to make the church
respected in the eyes of the world... Origen was the greatest scholar of
his age, and the most learned and genial of all the ante-Nicene fathers.
Even heathens and heretics admired or feared his brilliant talents. His
knowledge embraced all departments of the philology, philosophy and
theology of his day. With this he united profound and fertile thought,
keen penetration, and glowing imagination. As a true divine he
consecrated all his studies by prayer, and turned them, according to his
best convictions, to the service of truth and piety.\"[^230]

While chained in prison, his feet in the stocks, his constant theme was:
\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" His last
thought was for his brethren. "He has left the memory of one of the
greatest theologians and greatest saints the church has ever possessed.
One of his own words strikes the key-note of his life: \'Love,\' he says
again and again, \'is an agony, a passion;\' *\'Caritas est passio*.\'
To love the truth so as to suffer for it in the world and in the church,
to love mankind with a tender sympathy; to extend the arms of compassion
ever more widely, so as to over-pass all barriers of dogmatic difference
under the far-reaching impulse of this pitying love; to realize that the
essence of love is sacrifice, and to make self the unreserved and
willing victim, such was the creed, such was the life of Origen."[^231]

He described in letters now lost, the sufferings he endured without the
martyrdom he so longed for, and yet in terms of patience and Christian
forgiveness. Persecuted by Pagans for his Christian fidelity, and by
Christians for heresy, driven from home and country, and after his death
his morals questioned, his memory branded, his name anathematized, and
even his salvation denied,[^232] there is not a character in the annals
of Christendom more unjustly treated.

Eusebius relates how Origen bore in his old age, as in his youth,
fearful sufferings for his fidelity to his Master, and carried the scars
of persecution into his grave. No nobler witness to the truth is found
in the records of Christian fidelity. And, as though the terrible
persecutions he suffered during life were not enough, he has for fifteen
hundred years borne obloquy, reproach, and denunciation from professing
Christians who were unworthy to loosen his shoe latchets. Most of those
who decried him during his lifetime, and for a century after, were men
whose characters were of an inferior, and some of a very low order; but
the candid Nicephorus, a hundred and fifty years after his death, wrote
that he was "held in great glory in all the world."

This greatest of all Christian apologists and exegetes, and the first
man in Christendom since Paul, was a distinctive Universalist. He could
not have misunderstood or misrepresented the teachings of his Master.
The language of the New Testament was his mother tongue. He derived the
teachings of Christ from Christ himself in a direct line through his
teacher Clement; and he placed the defense of Christianity on
Universalistic grounds. When Celsus, in his *True Discourse*, the first
great assault on Christianity, objected to Christianity on the ground
that it taught punishment by fire, Origen replied that the threatened
fire possessed a disciplinary, purifying quality that will consume in
the sinner whatever evil material it can find to consume.

## Gehenna Denotes a Purifying Fire.

Origen declares that Gehenna is an analogue of the Valley of Hinnom and
connotates a purifying fire[^233] but intimates that it is not prudent
to go further, showing that the idea of "reserve" controlled him from
saying what might not be judicious. That God\'s fire is not material,
but spiritual remorse ending in reformation, Origen teaches in many
passages. He repeatedly speaks of punishment as *aionion* (mistranslated
in the New Testament \"everlasting,\" \"eternal\") and then elaborately
states and defends as Christian doctrine universal salvation beyond all
*aionion* suffering and sin.

Says the candid historian Robertson: \"The great object of this eminent
teacher was to harmonize Christianity with philosophy. He sought to
combine in a Christian scheme the fragmentary truths scattered
throughout other systems, to establish the Gospel in a form which should
not present obstacles to the conversion of Jews, of Gnostics, and of
cultivated heathens; and his errors arose from a too eager pursuit of
this idea.\"[^234]

The effect of his broad faith on his spirit and treatment of others, is
in strong contrast to the bitter and cruel disposition exhibited by some
of the early Christians towards heretics, such as Tertullian and
Augustine. In reply to the charge that Christians of different creeds
were in enmity, he said, \"Such of us as follow the doctrines of Jesus,
and endeavor to be conformed to his precepts, in our thoughts, words and
actions; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being
defamed, we entreat. Nor do we say injurious things of those who think
differently of us. They who consider the words of our Lord, Blessed are
the peaceable, and Blessed are the meek, will not hate those who corrupt
the Christian religion, nor give opprobrious names to those who are in
error.\"

When a young teacher his zeal and firmness vindicated his name
Adamantius, man of steel or adamant. Says De Pressense: \"The example of
Origen was of much force in sustaining the courage of his disciples. He
might be seen constantly in the prison of the pious captives carrying to
them the consolation they needed. He stood by them till the last moment
of triumph came, and gave them the parting kiss of peace on the very
threshold of the arena or at the foot of the stake.\" One day he was
carried to the temple of Serapis, and palms were placed in his hands to
lay on the altar of the Egyptian god. Brandishing the boughs, he
exclaimed, "Here are the triumphal palms, not of the idol, but of
Christ."

In a work of Origen\'s now only existing in a Latin translation is this
characteristic thought: "The fields of the angels are our hearts; each
one of them therefore out of the field which he cultivates, offers first
fruits to God. If I should be able to produce today some choice
interpretation, worthy to be presented to the Supreme High Priest, so
that out of all those things which we speak and teach, there should be
somewhat considerable which may please the great High Priest, it might
possibly happen that the angel who presides over the church, out of all
our words, might choose something, and offer it as a kind of first
fruits to the Lord, out of the small field of my heart. But I know I do
not deserve it; nor am I conscious to myself that any interpretation is
discovered by me which the angel who cultivates us should judge worthy
to offer to the Lord, as first fruits, or first born."[^235]

## His Critics are his Eulogists.

Origen\'s critics are his eulogists. Gieseler remarks: \"To the wide
extended influence of his writings it is to be attributed, that, in the
midst of these furious controversies (in the Fifth Century) there
remained any freedom of theological speculation whatever.\"

Bunsen: \"Origen\'s death is the real end of free Christianity and, in
particular, of free intellectual theology.\"

Schaff says: \"Origen is father of the scientific and critical
investigation of Scripture.\"

Jerome says he wrote more than other men can read.

Epiphanius, an opponent, states the number of his works as six thousand.
His books that survive are mostly in Latin, more or less mutilated by
translators.

Eusebius says that his life is worthy of being recorded from \"his
tender infancy.\" Even when a child \"he was wholly borne away by the
desire of becoming a martyr,\" and so divine a spirit did he show, and
such devotedness to his religion, even as a child, that his father,
frequently, \"when standing over his sleeping boy, would uncover his
breast, and as a shrine consecrated by the Divine Spirit, reverently
kiss the breast of his favorite offspring.... As his doctrine so was his
life; and as his life, so also was his doctrine."

His Bishop, Demetrius, praised him highly, till \"seeing him doing well,
great and illustrious and celebrated by all, was overcome by human
infirmity,\" and traduced him throughout the church.

Origen was followed as teacher in the Alexandrine school by his pupil
Heraclas, who in turn was succeeded by Dionysius, another pupil, so that
from Pantaenus, to Clemens, Origen, Heraclas and Dionysius, to Didymus,
from say 160 to 390 AD, more than two centuries, the teaching in
Alexandria, the very center of Christian learning, was Universalistic.

The struggles of such a spirit, scholar, saint, philosopher, must have
been a martyrdom, and illustrate the power of his sublime faith, not
only to sustain in the terrific trials through which he passed, but to
preserve the spirit he always manifested --- akin to that which cried on
the cross, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do."

## The Death of Origen.

The death of Origen marks an epoch in Christianity and signalizes the
beginning of a period of decadence. The republicanism of Christianity
began to give way before the monarchical tendencies that ripened with
Constantine (313 AD) and the Nicean council (325 AD). Clement and Origen
represented freedom of thought, and a rational creed founded on the
Bible, but the evil change that Christianity was soon to experience, was
fairly seen, says Bunsen, about the time of Origen\'s death. "Origen,
who had made a last attempt to preserve liberty of thought along with a
rational belief in historical facts based upon the historical records,
had failed in his gigantic efforts; he died of a broken heart rather
than of the wounds inflicted by his heathen torturers. His
followers...retained only his mystical scholasticism, without possessing
either his genius or his learning, his great and wide heart, or his
free, truth-speaking spirit. More and more the teachers became bishops,
and the bishops absolute governors, the majority of whom strove to
establish as law their speculations upon Christianity."

## A Christian Philosopher.

His comprehensive mind and vast sympathy, and his intense tendency to
generalization, caused Origen to entertain hospitably in his
philosophical system many ideas that now are seen to be inconsistent and
untenable; but his fantastic, allegorical interpretation of Scripture,
his vagaries concerning pre-existence, and his disposition to include
all themes and theories in his system, did not swerve him from the
truths and facts of Christian revelation. His defects were but as spots
on the sun. And his vagaries were by no means in excess of those of the
average theologian of his times.

Origen considered philosophy as necessary to Christianity as is geometry
to philosophy; but that all things essential to salvation are plainly
taught in the Scriptures, within the comprehension of the ordinary mind.

\"Origen...was the prince of schoolmen and scholars, as subtle as
Aquinas, as erudite as Routh or Tischendorf. He is a man of one book, in
a sense. The Bible, its text, its exposition, furnished him with the
motive for incessant toil.\"[^236]

The truths taught in the Bible may be made by philosophers themes on
which the mind may indefinitely expatiate; and those competent will find
interior, spiritual, recondite meanings not seen on the surface. Yet he
constantly taught \"that such affinity and congruity exist between
Christianity and human reason, that not only the grounds, but also the
forms, of all Christian doctrines may be explained by the dictates of
philosophy.... That it is vastly important to the honor and advantage of
Christianity that all its doctrines be traced back to the sources of all
truth, or be shown to flow from the principles of philosophy; and
consequently that a Christian theologian should exert his ingenuity and
his industry primarily to demonstrate the harmony between religion and
reason, and to show that there is nothing taught in the Scriptures but
what is founded in reason."

## A Bible Universalist.

He held to the "most scrupulous Biblicism and the most conscientious
regard for the rule of faith, conjoined with the philosophy of
religion." ... He "was the most influential theologian in the Oriental
church, the father of theological science, the author of ecclesiastical
dogmatics.... An orthodox traditionalist, a strong Biblical theologian,
a keen idealistic philosopher who translated the content of faith into
ideas, completed the structure of the world that is within, and finally
let nothing pass save knowledge of God and of self, in closest union,
which exalts us above the world, and conducts unto deification.... Life
is a discipline, a conflict under the permission and leading of God,
which will end with the conquest and destruction of evil.... According
to Origen, all spirits will, in the form of their individual lives, be
finally rescued and glorified (*apokatastasis*).\"[^237] Mosheim
considered these fatal errors, while we should regard them as valuable
principles. The famous historian assures us that Origen was entirely
ignorant of the doctrine of Christ\'s substitutional sacrifice. He had
no faith in the idea that Christ suffered in man\'s stead but taught
that he died in man\'s behalf.

## The Works of Origen.

The known works of Origen consist of brief *Notes on Scripture*, only a
few fragments of which are left; his *Commentaries*, many of which are
in Migne\'s collection; his *Contra Celsum*, or *Against Celsus*, which
is complete and in the original Greek; *Stromata*, only three fragments
of which survive in a Latin translation; a fragment on the
*Resurrection*; practical *Essays and Letters*, but two of the latter
remaining, and *Of Principles* (Latin: *De Principiis*).[^238] Nearly
all the original Greek of this great work has perished. The Latin
translation by Rufinus is very loose and inaccurate. It is frequently a
mere paraphrase. Jerome, whose translation is better than that of
Rufinus, accuses the latter of unfaithfulness in his translation, and
made a new version, only small portions of which have come down to
modern times, so that we cannot accurately judge of the character of
this great work. A comparison of the Greek of Origen\'s *Against Celsus*
with the Latin version of Rufinus exhibits great discrepancies. Indeed,
Rufinus confesses that he had so \"smoothed and corrected\" as to leave
\"nothing which could appear discordant with our belief.\" He claimed,
however, that he had done so because "his (Origen\'s) books had been
corrupted by heretics and malevolent persons," and accordingly he had
suppressed or enlarged the text to what he thought Origen ought to have
said! And having acknowledged so much he adjures all by their "belief in
the kingdom to come, by the mystery of the resurrection from the dead,
and by that everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels" to
make no further alterations! He reiterates his confession elsewhere and
says he has translated nothing that seems to him to contradict Origen\'s
other opinions, but has passed it by, as \"interpolated and forged.\"
For the sake of \"brevity,\" he says he has sometimes "curtailed."

Says De Pressense: "Celsus collected in his quiver all the objections
possible to be made, and there is scarcely one missing of all the arrows
which in subsequent times have been aimed against the supernatural in
Christianity." To every point made by Celsus, Origen made a triumphant
reply, anticipating, in fact, modern objections, and "gave to Christian
antiquity its most complete apology.... Many centuries were to elapse
before the church could present to the world any other defense of her
faith comparable to this noble book." "It remains the masterpiece of
ancient apology, for solidity of basis, vigor of argument, and breadth
of eloquent exposition. The apologists of every age were to find in it
an inexhaustible mine, as well as incomparable model of that royal,
moral method inaugurated by St. Paul and St. John."

An illustration of his manner may be given in his reference to the
attack of Celsus on the miracles of Christ. Celsus dares not deny them,
only a hundred years after Christ, and says: \"Be it so, we accept the
facts as genuine,\" and then proceeds to rank them with the tricks of
Egyptian sorcerers, and asks: "Did anyone ever look upon those impostors
as divinely aided, who for hire healed the sick and wrought wonderful
works? If Jesus did work miracles it was through sorcery, and deserves
therefore the greater contempt." In reply Origen insists on the miracles
but places the higher evidence of Christianity on a moral basis. He
says: "Show me the magician who calls upon the spectators of his
prodigies to reform their life, or who teaches his admirers the fear of
God, and seeks to persuade them to act as those who must appear before
him as their judge. The magicians do nothing of the sort, either because
they are incapable of it, or because they have no such desire.
Themselves charged with crimes the most shameful and infamous, how
should they attempt the reformation of the morals of others? The
miracles of Christ, on the contrary, all bear the impress of his own
holiness, and he ever uses them as a means of winning to the cause of
goodness and truth those who witness them. Thus he presented his own
life as the perfect model, not only to his immediate disciples, but to
all men. He taught his disciples to make known to those who heard them,
the perfect will of God; and he revealed to mankind, far more by his
life and works than by his miracles, the secret of that holiness by
which it is possible in all things to please God. If such was the life
of Jesus, how can he be compared to mere charlatans, and why may we not
believe that he was indeed God manifested in the flesh for the salvation
of our race?"[^239]

The historian Cave says: \"Celsus was an Epicurean philosopher
contemporary with Lucian, the witty atheist...a man of wit and parts,
and had all the advantages which learning, philosophy, and eloquence
could add to him; but a severe and incurable enemy to the Christian
religion, against which he wrote a book entitled Αληθὴς λόγος, or \'The
True Discourse,\' wherein he attempted Christianity with all the arts of
insinuation, all the wicked reflections, virulent aspersions, plausible
reasons, where-unto a man of parts and malice was capable to assault it.
To this Origen returns a full and solid answer, in eight books; wherein,
as he had the better cause, so he managed it with that strength of
reason, clearness of argument, and convictive evidence of truth, that
were there nothing else to testify the abilities of this great man, this
book alone were enough to do it."

## The Final Answer to Skepticism.

Eusebius declared that Origen "not only answered all the objections that
had ever been brought, but had supplied in anticipation answers to all
that ever could be brought against Christianity." Celsus, the ablest of
all the assailants of Christianity, wrote his *True Discourse* about a
century before Origen\'s time. It is the fountain whence the enemies of
Christianity have obtained the materials for their attacks on the
Christian religion. It garbles texts, confounds the different heresies
with the accepted form of Christianity, and employs the keenest logic,
the bitterest sarcasm, and all the weapons of the most accomplished and
unscrupulous controversy, and exhausts learning, argument, irony,
calumny, and all the skilled resources of one of the ablest of men in
his assault on the new religion. Origen\'s reply, written in 249 AD,
proceeds on the ground already established by Clement: the essential
relation between God and man; the universal operation of God\'s grace;
the preparation for the Gospel by Paganism; the residence of the genius
of divinity in each human soul; the resurrection of the soul rather than
of the body, and the curative power of all the divine punishments. He
triumphantly meets Celsus on every point, argument with argument,
invective with invective, satire with satire, and through all breathes a
sublime and lofty spirit, immeasurably superior to that of his opponent.
He leaves nothing of the great skeptic\'s unanswered.

Among the points made by Celsus and thoroughly disposed of by Origen
were some that have in recent years been presented: that there is
nothing new in Christian teaching; that the pretended miracles were not
by the supernatural act of God; that the prophecies were misapplied and
unfulfilled; that Christ borrowed from Plato, etc.

## The First of Christian Theologians.

The first system of Christian theology ever framed --- let it never be
forgotten --- was published by Origen, 230 AD, and it declared universal
restoration as the issue of the divine government; so that this eminent
Universalist has the grand pre-eminence of being not only the founder of
scientific Christian theology, but also the first great defender of the
Christian religion against its assailants. *De Principiis* is a profound
book, a fundamental and essential element of which is the doctrine of
the universal restoration of all fallen beings to their original
holiness and union with God.

Origen\'s most learned production was the *Hexapla*. He was twenty-eight
years on this great Biblical work. The first form was the *Tetrapla*,
containing in four columns the *Septuagint*, and the texts of Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion. This he enlarged into *Hexapla* with the
Hebrew text in both Hebrew and Greek letters. Many of the books of the
Bible had two additional columns, and some a seventh Greek version. This
was the *Octapla*. This immense monument of learning and industry
consisted of fifty volumes. It was never transcribed, and perished,
probably destroyed by the Arabs in the destruction of the Alexandrian
Library.[^240]

Origen was of medium height, but of such vigor and physical endurance
that he acquired the title Adamantius, the man of steel, or adamant. But
he constantly wore a demeanor of benignity and majesty, of kindliness
and sanctity, that won all with whom he came in contact.

## Quotation of Origen\'s Language. 

The following statements from the pen of Origen, and abstracts of his
views by eminent authors of different creeds, will show the great
scholar\'s ideas of human destiny. Many more than are here given might
be presented, but enough are quoted to demonstrate beyond a peradventure
that the great philosopher and divine, the equally great scholar and
saint, was a Universalist. There is no little difficulty in reaching
Origen\'s opinions on some topics --- happily not on man\'s final
destiny --- in consequence of most of his works existing only in Latin
translations confessedly inaccurate. He complained of perversions while
living and warned against misconstruction.[^241] But no believer in
endless punishment can claim the sanction of his great name.

He writes: "The end of the world, then, and the final consummation will
take place when everyone shall be subjected to punishment for his sins;
a time which God alone knows, when he will bestow on each one what he
deserves. We think, indeed, that the goodness of God, through his
Christ, may recall all his creatures to one end, even his enemies being
conquered and subdued. For thus says Holy Scripture, 'The Lord said to
my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
footstool.' And if the meaning of the prophet be less clear, we may
ascertain it from the apostle Paul, who speaks more openly, thus: 'For
Christ must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet.' But even
if that unreserved declaration of the apostle do not sufficiently inform
us what is meant by 'enemies being placed under his feet,' listen to
what he says in the following words: 'For all things must be put under
him.' What, then, is this 'putting under' by which all things must be
made subject to Christ? I am of opinion that it is this very subjection
by which we also wish to be subject to him, by which the apostles also
were subject, and all the saints who have been followers of Christ. For
the word 'subjection,' by which we are subject to Christ, indicates that
the salvation which proceeds from him belongs to his subjects, agreeably
to the declaration of David, \'Shall not my soul be subject unto God?
From him Cometh my salvation.'" ... "Seeing, then, that such is the end,
when all enemies will be subdued to Christ, when death--- the last
enemy--- shall be destroyed, and when the kingdom shall be delivered up
by Christ (to whom all things are subject) to God the Father; let us, I
say, from such an end as this, contemplate the beginnings of things."
... "The apostolic teaching is that the soul, having a substance and
lite of its own, shall, after its departure from the world, be rewarded
according to its deserts, being destined to obtain either an inheritance
of eternal life and blessedness, if its actions shall have procured this
for it, or to be delivered up to eternal fire and punishments, if the
guilt of its crimes shall have brought it down to this."[^242]

Unquestionably Origen, in the original Greek of which the Latin
translation only exists, here used "*aionios*" (inaccurately rendered
everlasting and eternal in the New Testament) in the sense of limited
duration; and fire, as an emblem of purification, for he says:

"When you hear of the wrath of God, believe not that this wrath and
indignation are passions of God; they are condescensions of language
designed to convert and improve the child.... So God is described as
angry, and says that he is indignant, in order that you may convert and
be improved, while in fact he is not angry."[^243]

Origen severely condemns those who cherish unworthy thoughts of God,
regarding him, he says, as possessing a disposition that would be a
slander on a wicked savage. He insists that the purpose of all
punishment, by a good God, must be medicinal.[^244]

In arguing that *aionios* as applied to punishment does not mean
endless, he says that the sin that is not forgiven in this *aeon* or the
*aeon* to come, would be in some one of the *aeons* following. His
argument that age (undoubtedly *aion* in the original, of which,
unfortunately, we have only the Latin translation) is limited, is quite
complete in *De Principiis*. This world is an age (*saeculum, aion*) and
a conclusion of many ages (*seculorum*). He concludes his argument by
referring to the time when, beyond ages," that period will come, viz.,
when all things are no longer in an age, but when God is all in
all.[^245]

He quotes the Scripture phrase "Forever and ever and beyond" (*in
saeculum et in saeculum et adhuc*, forever and further), and insists
that evil, being a negation, cannot be eternal.[^246]

Dr. Bigg sums up Origen\'s views: "Slowly yet certainly the blessed
change must come, the purifying fire must eat up the dross and leave the
pure gold.... One by one we shall enter into rest, never to stray again.
Then when death, the last enemy, is destroyed, when the tale of his
children is complete, Christ will 'drink wine in the kingdom of his
Father.' This is the end, when 'all shall be one, as Christ and the
Father are one,' when 'God shall be all in all.'"

Origen never dogmatizes; rests largely on general principles; says that
\"justice and goodness are in their highest manifestations identical;
that God does not punish, but has made man so that in virtue only can he
find peace and happiness, because he has made him like himself; that
suffering is not a tax upon sin, but the wholesome reaction by which the
diseased soul struggles to cast out the poison of its malady; that,
therefore, if we have done wrong it is good to suffer, because the
anguish of returning health will cease when health is restored, and
cannot cease till then. Again, that evil is against the plan of God, is
created not by him but by ourselves; is therefore, properly speaking, a
negation, and as such cannot be eternal. These are, in the main, Greek
thoughts, their chief source is the *Gorgias* of Plato; but his final
appeal is always to Scripture."

Huet quotes Leontius as saying that Origen argued from the fact that
*aionios* means finite duration, the limited duration of future
punishment. Origen\'s argument for the termmability of punishment was
based on the meaning of this word *aionios*.[^247] Surely he, a
Platonist in his knowledge of Greek, should know its
signification.[^248]

## Origen on the Purifying Fire. 

On 1 Corinthians 3:2, he says:[^249] The fire that will consume the
world at the last day is a purifying fire, which all must pass through,
though it will impart no pain to the good. In expressing eternity Origen
does not depend upon *aion*, but qualifies the word by an adjective,
thus: --- *ton apeiron aiona*. Barnabas, Hermas, *Sibylline Oracles*,
Justin Martyr, Polycarp, Theophilus and Irenaeus all apply the word
*aionios* to punishment, but two of these taught annihilation, and one
universal salvation beyond *aionion* punishment.

God is a "Consuming Fire," Origen thinks, because he "does indeed
consume and utterly destroy; that he consumes evil thoughts, wicked
actions, and sinful desires when they find their way into the minds of
believers." He teaches that "God\'s consuming fire works with the good
as with the evil, annihilating that which harms his children. This fire
is one that each one kindles; the fuel and food is each one\'s
sins."[^250] "What is the meaning of eternal fire?" he asks: \"When the
soul has gathered together a multitude of evil works, and an abundance
of sins against itself, at a suitable time all that assembly of evils
boils up to punishment, and is set on fire to chastisement," etc. Just
as physicians employ drugs, and sometimes "the evil has to be burned out
by fire, how much more is it to be understood that God our Physician,
desiring to remove the defects of our souls, should apply the punishment
of fire." ... "Our God is a \'consuming fire\' in the sense in which we
have taken the word; and thus he enters in as a \'refiner\'s fire\' to
refine the rational nature, which has been filled with the lead of
wickedness, and to free it from the other impure materials which
adulterate the natural gold or silver, so to speak, of the soul."
Towards the conclusion of his reply to Celsus, Origen has the following
passage: "The Stoics, indeed, hold that when the strongest of the
elements prevails all things shall be turned into fire. But our belief
is that the Word shall prevail over the entire rational creation, and
change every soul into his own perfection; in which state every one, by
the mere exercise of his power, will choose what he desires, and obtain
what he chooses. For although, in the diseases and wounds of the body,
there are some which no medical skill can cure, yet we hold that in the
mind there is no evil so strong that it may not be overcome by the
Supreme Word and God. For stronger than all the evils in the soul is the
Word, and the healing power that dwells in him; and this healing he
applies, according to the will of God, to every man. The consummation of
all things is the destruction of evil, although as to the question
whether it shall be so destroyed that it can never anywhere arise again,
it is beyond our present purpose to say. Many things are said obscurely
in the prophecies on the total destruction of evil, and the restoration
to righteousness of every soul; but it will be enough for our present
purpose to quote the following passage from Zephaniah," etc.[^251]

Thus Origen interprets "fire" in the Bible not only as a symbol of the
sinner\'s suffering but of his purification. The "consuming fire" is a
"refiner\'s fire." It consumes the sins and refines and purifies the
sinner. It burns the sinner\'s works, "hay, wood and stubble," that
result from wickedness. The torture is real, the purification sure; fire
is a symbol of God\'s severe, certain, but salutary discipline. God\'s
"wrath" is apparent, not real. There is no passion on his part. What we
call wrath is another name for his disciplinary processes. God would not
tell us to put away anger, wrath (Origen says) and then be guilty
himself of what he prohibits in us. He declares that the punishment
which is said to be by fire is understood to be applied with the object
of healing, as taught by Isaiah, etc. (13:16; 47:14, 15; 10:17). The
"eternal fire" is curative.

## Origen on Gehenna.

Gehenna and its fires have the same signification: "We find that what
was termed \'Gehenna\' or \'the Valley of Hinnom,\' was included in the
lot of the tribe of Benjamin, in which Jerusalem also was situated. And
seeking to ascertain what might be the inference from the heavenly
Jerusalem belonging to the lot of Benjamin, and the Valley of Hinnom, we
find a certain confirmation of what is said regarding the place of
punishment, intended for the purification of such souls as are to be
purified by torments, agreeably to the same, --- 'the Lord comes like a
refiner\'s fire and like fuller\'s soap; and he shall sit as a refiner
and purifier of silver and of gold.'"[^252]

## Views of "Foolish Christians" on Fire.

In reply to the charge of Celsus that Christians teach that sinners will
be burnt up by the fires of judgment, Origen replies that such thoughts
had been entertained by certain foolish Christians, who were unable to
see distinctly the sense of each particular passage or unwilling to
devote the necessary labor to the investigation of Scripture.... And
perhaps, as it is appropriate to children that some things should be
addressed to them in a manner befitting their infantile condition, to
convert them...so such ideas as Celsus refers to are taught." But he
adds that "those who require the administration of punishment by fire"
experience it "with a view to an end which is suitable for God to bring
upon those who have been created in his image." In reply to the charge
of Celsus that Christians teach that God will act the part of a cook in
burning men, Origen says, --- "not like a cook but like a God who is a
benefactor of those who stand in need of discipline of fire."[^253]

Origen declares that sinners who are "incurable" are converted by the
threat of punishment. "As to the punishments threatened against the
ungodly, these will come upon them after they have refused all remedies,
and have been, as we may say, visited with an incurable malady of
sinfulness. Such is our doctrine of punishment; and the inculcation of
this doctrine turns many away from their sins."[^254]

Pamphilus and Eusebius in their *Apology for Origen* quote these words
from him: \"We are to understand that God, our physician, in order to
remove those disorders which our souls contract from various sins and
abominations, uses that painful mode of cure, and brings those torments
of fire upon such as have lost the health of the soul, just as an
earthly physician in extreme cases subjects his patients to cautery.\"

But Origen always makes salvation depend on the consenting will; hence
he says, (De Prin. 2, 1:2), "God the Father of all things, in order to
ensure the salvation of all his creatures through the ineffable plan of
his Word and wisdom, so arranged each of these, that every spirit,
whether soul or rational existence, however called, should not be
compelled by force, against the liberty of his own will, to any other
course than that to which the motives of his own mind led him."

Origen teaches that in the final estate of universal human happiness
there will be differing degrees of blessedness. After quoting 1
Thessalonians 4:15-17, he says: "A diversity of translation and a
different glory will be given to every one according to the merits of
his actions; and every one will be in that order which the merits of his
work have procured for him."

## Mosheim and Robertson.

Mosheim thus expresses Origen\'s views: "As all divine punishments are
salutary and useful, so also that which divine justice has inflicted on
vitiated souls, although it is a great evil, is nevertheless salutary in
its tendency, and should conduct them to blessedness. For the tiresome
conflict of opposite propensities, the onsets of the passions, the pains
and sorrows and other evils arising from the connection of the mind with
the body, and with a sentient soul, may and should excite the captive
soul to long for the recovery of its lost happiness, and lead it to
concentrate all its energies in order to escape from its misery. For God
acts like a physician, who employs harsh and bitter remedies, not only
to cure the diseased, but also to induce them to preserve their health
and to avoid whatever might impair it.\"[^255]

The candid historian Robertson gives an accurate statement of Origen\'s
eschatology, with references to his works, as follows: "All punishment,
he holds, is merely corrective and remedial, being ordained in order
that all creatures may be restored to their original perfection. At the
resurrection all mankind will have to pass through a fire; the purged
spirits will enter into Paradise, a place of training for the
consummation; the wicked will remain in the \'fire,\' which, however, is
not described as material, but as a mental and spiritual misery. The
matter and food of it, he says, are our sins, which, when swollen to the
height, are inflamed to become our punishment; and the outer darkness is
the darkness of ignorance. But the condition of these spirits is not
without hope, although thousands of years may elapse before their
suffering shall have wrought its due effect on them. On the other hand,
those who are admitted into Paradise may abuse their free will, as in
the beginning, and may consequently be doomed to a renewal of their
sojourn in the flesh. Every reasonable creature --- even Satan himself
--- may be turned from evil to good, so as not to be excluded from
salvation."[^256]

Notwithstanding Robertson\'s doubt, expressed elsewhere in his history,
whether Origen taught the salvability of \"devils,\" Origen\'s language
is clear. He says: "But whether any of these orders who act under the
government of the Devil...will in a future world be converted to
righteousness...or whether persistent and inveterate wickedness may be
changed by the power of habit into nature, is a result which you
yourself, reader, may approve of;" but he goes on to say that in the
eternal and invisible worlds, "all those beings are arranged according
to a regular plan, in the order and degree of their merits; so that some
of them in the first, others in the second, some even in the last times,
after having undergone heavier and severer punishments, endured for a
lengthened period, and for many ages, so to speak, improved by this
stern method of training, and restored at first by the instruction of
the angels, and subsequently by the powers of a higher grade and thus
advancing through each stage to a better condition, reach even to that
which is invisible and eternal, having traveled through, by a kind of
training, every single office of the heavenly powers. From which, I
think, this will appear to follow as an inference that every rational
nature may, in passing from one order to another, go through each to
all, and advance from all to each, while made the subject of various
degrees of proficiency and failure according to its own actions and
endeavors, put forth in the enjoyment of its power of freedom of
will."[^257]

## The *Dictionary of Christian Biography*.

Says the *Dictionary of Christian Biography*: Origen "openly proclaims
his belief that the goodness of God, when each sinner shall have
received the penalty of his sins, will, through Christ, lead the whole
universe to one end." "He is led to examine into the nature of the fire
which tries every man\'s work, and is the penalty of evil, and he finds
it in the mind itself --- in the memory of evil. The sinner\'s life lies
before him as an open scroll, and he looks on it with shame and anguish
unspeakable. The Physician of our souls can use his own processes of
healing. The 'outer darkness' and Paradise are but different stages in
the education of the great school of souls, and their upward and onward
progress depends on their purity and love of truth. He who is saved is
saved as by fire, that if he has in him any mixture of lead the fire may
melt it out, so that all may be made as the pure gold. The more the lead
the greater will be the burning, so that even if there be but little
gold, that little will be purified.... The fire of the last day, will,
it may be, be at once a punishment and a remedy, burning up the wood,
hay, stubble, according to each man\'s merits, yet all working to the
destined end of restoring man to the image of God, though, as yet, men
must be treated as children, and the terrors of the judgment rather than
the final restoration have to be brought before those who can be
converted only by fears and threats.... Gehenna stands for the torments
that cleanse the soul, but for the many who are scarcely restrained by
the fears of eternal torments, it is not expedient to go far into that
matter, hardly, indeed, to commit our thoughts to writing, but to dwell
on the certain and inevitable retribution for all evil.... God is indeed
a consuming fire, but that which he consumes is the evil that is in the
souls of men, not the souls themselves.\"[^258]

## Translation of Origen\'s Language on Universal Restoration. 

Crombie\'s translation[^259] thus renders Origen: \"But as it is in
mockery that Celsus says we speak of 'God coming down like a torturer
bearing fire' and thus compels us unseasonably to investigate words of
deeper meaning, we shall make a few remarks.... The divine Word says
that our \'God is a consuming fire\' and that \'He draws rivers of fire
before him;\' nay, that he even enters in as \'a refiner\'s fire, and as
a fuller\'s herb\' to purify his own people. But when he is said to be a
'consuming fire' we inquire what are the things which are appropriate to
be consumed by God. And we assert that they are wickedness and the works
which result from it, and which, being figuratively called \'wood, hay,
stubble,\' God consumes as a fire. The wicked man, accordingly, is said
to build up on the previously laid foundation of reason, \' wood, and
hay, and stubble.\' If, then, any one can show that these words were
differently understood by the writer, and can prove that the wicked man
literally builds up \'wood, or hay, or stubble,\' it is evident that the
fire must be understood to be material, and an object of sense. But if,
on the contrary, the works of the wicked man are spoken of figuratively,
under the names of \'wood, or hay, or stubble,\' why does it not at once
occur (to inquire) in what sense the word \'fire\' is to be taken, so
that \'wood\' of such a kind should be consumed? For the Scripture says:
\'The fire shall try each man\'s work of what sort it is. If any man\'s
work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If
any man\'s work be burned, he shall suffer loss.\' But what work can be
spoken of in these words as being \' burned,\' save all that results
from wickedness?\"[^260]

One of the unaccountable mysteries of religious thinking is that all
Christians should not have agreed with Origen on this point. \"God is
Love;\" love, which from its nature can only consume that which is
inimical to its object, --- Man, and not man himself.

Again, \"If then that subjection be good and salutary by which the Son
is said to be subject to the Father, it is an extremely rational and
logical inference to deduce that the subjection also of enemies which is
said to be made to the Son of God, should be understood as being also
salutary and useful; as if, when the Son is said to be subject to the
Father, the perfect restoration of the whole of creation is signified,
so also, when enemies are said to be subjected to the Son of God, the
salvation of the conquered and the restoration of the lost is in that
understood to consist. This subjection, however, will be accomplished in
certain ways, and after certain training, and at certain times; for it
is not to be imagined that the subjection is to be brought about by the
pressure of necessity (lest the whole world should then appear to be
subdued to God by force), but by word, reason and doctrine; by a call to
a better course of things; by the best systems of training; by the
employment also of suitable and appropriate threatenings, which will
justly impend over those who despise any care or attention to their
salvation and useful- ness."[^261] \"I am of opinion that the expression
by which God is said to be \'all in all,\' means that he is \'all\' in
each individual person. Now he will be 'all' in each individual in this
way: when all which any rational understanding cleansed from the dregs
of every sort of vice, and with every cloud of wickedness completely
swept away, can either feel, or understand, or think, will be wholly
God; and when it will no longer behold or retain anything else than God,
but when God will be the measure and standard of all its movements, and
thus God will be 'all,' for there will no longer be any distinction of
good and evil, seeing evil nowhere exists; for God is all things, and to
him no evil is near.... So, then, when the end has been restored to the
beginning, and the termination of things compared with their
commencement, that condition of things will be reestablished in which
rational nature was placed, when it had no need to eat of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil; so that, when all feeling of wickedness
has been removed, and the individual has been purified and cleansed, he
who alone is the one good God becomes to him \'all,\' and that not in
the case of a few individuals, or of a considerable number, but he
himself is \'all in all.\' And when death shall no longer anywhere
exist, nor the sting of death, nor any evil at all, then verily God will
be \'all in all.\'" Thus the final restoration of the moral universe is
not to be wrought in violation of the will of the creature: the work of
\"transforming and restoring all things, in whatever manner they are
made, to some useful aim, and to the common advantage of all,\" no
\"soul or rational existence is compelled by force against the liberty
of his own will.\"[^262]

Again: \"Let us see now what is the freedom of the creature, or the
termination of its bondage. When Christ shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father, then also those living things, when
they shall have first been made the kingdom of Christ, shall be
delivered, along with the whole of that kingdom, to the rule of the
Father, that when God shall be all in all, they also, since they are a
part of all things, may have God in themselves, as he is in all
things.\" Origen regarded the application to punishment of the word
*aionios*, mistranslated everlasting, as in perfect harmony with this
view, saying that the punishment of sin, \"though \'*aionion*,\' is not
endless.\" He observes further: \"The last enemy, moreover, who is
called death, is said on this account (that all may be one, without
diversity) to be destroyed that there may not be anything left of a
mournful kind, when death does not exist, nor anything that is adverse
when there is no enemy. The destruction of the last enemy, indeed, is to
be understood not as if its substance, which was formed by God, is to
perish, but because its mind and hostile will, which came not from God,
but from itself, are to be destroyed. Its destruction, therefore, will
not be its non-existence, but its ceasing to be an enemy, and (to be)
death. And this result must be understood as being brought about not
suddenly, but slowly and gradually, seeing that the process of amendment
and correction will take place imperceptibly in the individual instances
during the lapse of countless and unmeasured ages, some outstripping
others, and tending by a swifter course towards perfection, while others
again follow close at hand, and some again a long way behind; and thus,
through the numerous and uncounted orders of progressive beings who are
being reconciled to God from a state of enmity, the last enemy is
finally reached, who is called death, so that he also may be destroyed
and no longer be an enemy. When, therefore, all rational souls shall
have been restored to a condition of this kind, then the nature of this
body of ours will undergo a change into the glory of a spiritual body.\"

In *Contra Celsum*,[^263] Origen says: \"We assert that the Word, who is
the Wisdom of God, shall bring together all intelligent creatures, and
convert them into his own perfection, through the instrumentality of
their free will and of their own exertions. The Word is more powerful
than all the diseases of the soul, and he applies his remedies to each
one according to the pleasure of God--- for the name of God is to be
invoked by all, so that all shall serve him with one consent.\"

## Mercy and Justice Harmonious.

The heresy that has wrought so much harm in modern theology, that
justness and goodness in God are different and hostile attributes was
advocated, Origen says, by \"some\" in his day, and he meets it
admirably,[^264] by showing that the two attributes are identical in
their purpose. \"Justice is goodness,\" he declares. \"God confers
benefits justly, and punishes with kindness, since neither goodness
without justice, nor justice without goodness, can display the dignity
of the divine nature.\"

## Origen's Grand Statement.

Origen argues that God must be passionless because unchanging. Wrath,
hatred, repentance, are ascribed to him in the Bible because human
infirmities require such a presentation. Punishment results from sin as
a legitimate consequence, and is not God\'s direct work.... In the
Restitution God\'s wrath will not be spoken of. God really has but one
passion --- Love. All he does illustrates some phase of this divine
emotion. He declares that with God the one fixed point is the End, when
God shall be all in all. All intelligent work has a perfect end. Of Col.
1:20 and Heb. 2:19, he says: Christ is \"the Great High Priest, not only
for man but for every rational creature.\" In his Homilies on Ezekiel,
he says: "If it had not been conducive to the conversion of sinners to
employ suffering, never would a compassionate and benevolent God have
inflicted punishment.\" Love, which \"never faileth,\" will preserve the
whole creation from all possibility of further fall; and \"God will be
all in all,\" forever.

## Note.

Celsus seems to have been the first heathen author to name the Christian
books, so that they were well-known within a century of our Lord\'s
death. We, undoubtedly, have every objection, advanced by him against
Christianity, preserved in Origen\'s reply. He not only attacks our
faith on minor points, but his chief assaults are directed to show that
the new religion is not a special revelation; that its doctrines are not
new; that it is not superior to other religions; that its doctrines are
unreasonable; that if God really spoke to men, it would not be to one
small nation, in an obscure corner; that the miracles (though actual
occurrences) were not wrought by divine power; that Jesus was not
divine, and did not rise from the dead; that Christianity is an
evolution. He took the same view as Renan, Strauss and modern
\"Rationalists,\" charging the supposed appearance of Jesus after his
crucifixion to the imaginings of \"a distracted woman,\" or to the
delusions of those who fancied what they desired to see.

Celsus sometimes selected the views of unauthorized Christians, as when
he charged that they worshiped Christ as God. Origen\'s reply proves
that Christ was held to be divine, but not Deity. He says: \"Granted
that there may be some individuals among the multitude of believers who
are not in entire agreement with us, and who incautiously assert that
the Savior is the most High God; we do not hold with them, but rather
believe him when he says: \"The Father who sent me is greater than I.\"
Had Christians then held Christ to be God, he could not have said this.

Celsus was the father of \"Rationalism,\" and Origen the exponent of a
reverent and rational Christian belief.

# 11. Origen (Continued). 

The students, biographers and critics of Origen of all schools of
thought and theology mainly agree in representing him as an explicit
promulgator of Universalism. Canon Westcott styles him the great
corrector of that Africanism which since Augustine has dominated Western
theology. He thus defines his views: \"All future punishments exactly
answer to individual sinfulness, and, like punishments on earth, they
are directed to the amendment of the sufferers. Lighter offenses can be
chastised on earth; the heavier remain to be visited hereafter. In every
case the uttermost farthing must be paid, though final deliverance is
promised.\"

## Blunt on Origen.

Blunt, in his excellent work, describes the heathen admixtures and
corruptions in manner, custom, habit, conduct and life that began to
prevail during the latter part of the Third Century, as the influence of
the great Alexandrine fathers waned, and the Latinizing of the church
began to assert itself.[^265]

## Dr. Bigg on Origen.

"There will come a time when man, completely subjected to Christ by the
operation of the Holy Ghost," says Bigg, epitomizing Origen, \"shall in
Christ be completely subjected to the Father. But now,\" he adds, \"the
end is always like the beginning. The manifold diversity of the world is
to close in unity, it must then have sprung from unity. His expansion of
this theory is in fact an elaborate commentary upon the eighth chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans and the fifteenth chapter of the First
Epistle to the Corinthians. Those, he felt, were the two keys, the one
to the eternity before, the other to the eternity after. What the church
cannot pardon, God may. The sin which has no forgiveness in this aeon or
the aeon to come, may be atoned for in some one of the countless aeons
of the vast hereafter.\" This exegesis serves to show us how the
primitive church treated the \"unpardonable sin.\" (Matt. 12:32) The sin
against the Holy Ghost \"shall not be forgiven in this world (*aion*,
age) nor in the world (*aion*, age) to come.\" According to Origen, it
may be in \"some one of the countless aeons of the vast hereafter.\"

## Schaff on Origen.

The historian Schaff concedes that among those quickened and inspired to
follow Origen were Pamphilus, Eusebius of Caesarea, Didymus of
Alexandria, Athanasius, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzum, and
Gregory of Nyssa; and among the Latin fathers, Hilary and Jerome. And he
feels obliged to add: \"Gregory of Nyssa and perhaps also Didymus, even
adhered to Origen\'s doctrine of the final salvation of all created
intelligences.\"[^266]

## Bunsen on Origen.

Bunsen declares that Origen adduces in \"De Principiis,\" in favor of
\"the universality of final salvation,\" the arguments of \"nearly all
the \"Ante - Nicene fathers before him.\" And Bunsen proceeds to show
that the conviction that so broad a faith would not enable hierarchs to
control the people, inclined his opponents to resort to the terrors of
an indefinite, and thus, to their apprehension, infinite and eternal
punishment, which has vengeance and not amendment for its end. \"Away
with Origen! What is to become of virtue, and heaven, and --- clerical
power, if the fear of eternal punishment is not forever kept before
men\'s eyes as the prop of human and divine authority?\" So thought
Demetrius, Bishop of Alexandria in 230. Bunsen adds that Origen taught
that \"the soul, having a substance and life of her own, will receive
her reward, according to her merits, either obtaining the inheritance of
eternal life and blessedness, or being delivered over to eternal death
and torments,\" after which comes the resurrection, the *anastasis*, the
rising into incorruption and glory, when \"finally at the end of time,
God will be all in all; not by the destruction of the creature, but by
its gradual elevation into his divine being. This is life eternal,
according to Christ\'s own teaching.\" Of the grand faith in universal
redemption, Prof. Plumptre says: \"It has been, and is, the creed of the
great poets whom we accept as the spokesmen of a nation\'s
thoughts.\"[^267]

## Origen Cruelly Treated.

The treatment experienced by Origen is one of the anomalies of history.
The first hostility to him, followed by his deposition and
excommunication, AD 232, is conceded to have been in consequence of his
opposition to the Episcopal tendencies of Bishop Demetrius, and the envy
of the bishop. His Universalism was not in question. Lardner says that
he was \"not expelled from Alexandria for heresy, but for envy.\" Bunsen
says: \"Demetrius induced a numerous synod of Egyptian bishops to
condemn as heretical...Origen\'s opinion respecting the universality of
final salvation.\" But Bunsen seems to contradict his own words by
adding: \"This opinion he had certainly stated so as even to hold out a
prospect of the conversion of Satan himself by the irresistible power of
the love of the Almighty,\" but he was condemned \"\'not,\' as says St.
Jerome, who was no friend to his theology, \'on account of novelty of
doctrine --- not for heresy --- but because they could not bear the
glory of his learning and eloquence.\'\" The opposition to Origen seems
to have begun in the petty anger of Demetrius, who was incensed because
Origen, a layman, delivered discourses in the presence of bishops
(Alexander and Theoctistus), though at their request, and because he was
ordained out of his diocese. Demetrius continued his persecutions until
he had degraded Origen from the office of presbyter, though all the
ecclesiastical authorities in Palestine refused to recognize the
validity of the sentence. His excommunication, however, was disregarded
by the bishops of Palestine, Arabia and Greece. Going from Alexandria to
Greece and Palestine, Origen was befriended by Bishop Firmilian in
Cappadocia for two years; and was also welcomed in Nicomedia and
Athens.[^268]

Huet says: \"Everyone, with hardly an exception, adhered to Origen.\"
And Doucin: \"Provided one had Origen on his side, he believed himself
certain to have the truth.\"

## Origen\'s Theology Generally Accepted. 

That his opinions were not obnoxious is proved by the fact that most of
his friends and followers were placed in charge of the most important
churches. Says De Pressense: \"The Eastern church of the Third Century
cancelled, in fact, the sentence passed upon Origen under the influence
of the hierarchical party. At Alexandria itself his disciples maintained
the pre-eminence, and at the death of Demetrius, Heraclas, who had been
the most intimate friend and trusted disciple of Origen, was raised to
the Episcopal dignity by the free choice of the elders.... Heraclas died
AD 249 and was succeeded by another disciple of Origen...Dionysius of
Alexandria.... He was an assiduous disciple of Origen, and with his
death the halcyon days of the school of Alexandria were now over.
Dionysius was the last of its great masters.\" It is to be deplored that
none of the writings of Dionysius are known to exist.

Theophylact, Bishop of Caesarea, expressed the most ardent friendship
for Origen, and offered him a refuge in Caesarea, and a position as
teacher. Firmilian, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, received Origen
during Maximin\'s persecution, and was always a fast friend. The
majority of the Palestinian bishops were friendly. Jerome mentions
Trypho as a disciple of Origen. He was author of several commentaries on
the Old Testament. Hippolytus is spoken of as \"a disciple of Origen and
Dionysius of Alexandria, \'the Origen of the West\'\"... attracted to
Origen \"by all the affinities of heart and mind.\"

## His Universalism Never Condemned.

The state of opinion on the subject of universal salvation is shown by
the fact that though Ignatius, Irenaeus, Hippolytus and others wrote
against the prevalent heresies of their times, Universalism is never
named as among them. Some of the alleged errors of Origen were
condemned, but his doctrine of universal salvation, never. Methodius,
who wrote AD 300; Pamphilus and Eusebius, AD 310; Eustathius, AD 380;
Epiphanius, AD 376 and 394; Theophilus, AD 400-404, and Jerome, A. D.
400; all give lists of Origen\'s errors, but none name his Universalism
among them. Besides, some of those who condemned his errors were
Universalists, as the school of Antioch. And many who were opponents of
Origenism were mentioned by Origen\'s enemies with honor notwithstanding
they were Universalists, as Clement of Alexandria, and Gregory of Nyssa.

Pamphilus and Eusebius, AD 307-310, jointly wrote an Apology for Origen
that contained declarations from the ancient fathers endorsing his views
of the Restitution. This work, had it survived, would undoubtedly be an
invaluable repository of evidence to show the general prevalence of his
views on the part of those whose writings have not been preserved. All
Christians must lament with Lardner the loss of a work that would have
told us so much of the great Alexandrian. It seems to have been the
fashion with the ancient Latin theologians to burn the books they could
not refute.

Farrar names the eminent ancients who mention Origen with greatest honor
and respect. Some, like Augustine, do not accept his views, but all
utter eulogistic words, many adopt his sentiments, and Eusebius added a
sixth book to the production of Pamphilus, in consequence of the
detractions against Origen. While he had his opponents and defamers, the
best and the most of his contemporaries and immediate successors either
accepted his doctrines or eulogized his goodness and greatness.

Origen bitterly lamented the misrepresentation of his views even during
his lifetime. How much more might he have said could he have foreseen
what would be said of him after his death.

Pamphilus, who was martyred AD 294, and Eusebius, in their lost Apology
for Origen, which is mentioned by at least two writers who had seen it,
gave many testimonies of fathers preceding Origen, favoring
Universalism,[^269] and Domitian, Bishop of Ancyra, complains that those
who condemn the restorationism of Origen \"anathematize all those saints
who preceded and followed him,\" implying the general prevalence of
Universalism before and after the days of Origen.

## Origen's Contemporaries.

Among the celebrated contemporaries and immediate successors of Origen
whose writings on the question of man\'s final destiny do not survive,
but who, from the relations they sustained to this greatest of the
Fathers, must have sympathized with his belief in universal restoration,
may be mentioned Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem (AD 216), a fellow
student; Theoctistus, Bishop of Caesarea (AD 240-260); Heraclas, Bishop
of Alexandria (AD 200-248); Ambrose (AD 200-230); Firmilian, Bishop of
Caesarea (AD 200-270); Athenodore, his brother (AD 210-270); all friends
and adherents of Origen. They must have cherished what was at the time
the prevalent sentiment among Oriental Christians --- a belief in
universal restoration --- though we have no testimonies from them.

On the unsupported statement of Jerome, Origen is declared to have
protested his orthodoxy to the reigning Pope, Fabian, AD 246, and
solicited re-admission to the communion of the church. He is said to
have laid the blame of the publication of some of his heterodox
sentiments to the haste of his friend Ambrose. But as Origen continued
to teach Universalism all the rest of his life the statement of Jerome
must be rejected, or universal restoration was not among the heterodox
doctrines. At the time Origen is said to have written the letter, his
pupil and friend, Dionysius, was Patriarch of Alexandria, and he wrote
to Pope Fabian and other bishops, it is probable, to effect a
reconciliation, to which Dionysius and most of the bishops would be
favorable. Besides, Origen is on record as classing all bishops as of
equal eminence, except as goodness gave them superior rank, so that he
could not have regarded Fabian as pope. That the general sentiment
during Origen\'s times and for some time after was universalistic is
thus made apparent.[^270]

## Ancient Universalist Schools. 

### Dr. Beecher's Testimony.

Dr. Beecher says: \"Two great facts stand out on the page of
ecclesiastical history. One, that the first system of Christian theology
was composed and issued by Origen in the year 230 after Christ, of which
a fundamental and essential element was the doctrine of the universal
restoration of all fallen beings to their original holiness and union
with God. The second is, that after the lapse of a little more than
three centuries, in the year 544, this doctrine was for the first time
condemned and anathematized as heretical.... From and after this point
(AD 553) the doctrine of eternal punishment reigned with undisputed sway
during the Middle Ages that preceded the Reformation.... What, then, was
the state of facts as to the leading theological schools of the
Christian world, in the age of Origen, and some centuries after? It was
in brief this: There were at least six theological schools in the church
at large. Of these six schools, one, and only one, was decidedly and
earnestly in favor of the doctrine of future eternal punishment. One was
in favor of the annihilation of the wicked, two were in favor of the
doctrine of universal restoration on the principles of Origen, and two
in favor of universal restoration on the principles of Theodore of
Mopsuestia. It is also true that the prominent defenders of the doctrine
of universal restoration were decided believers in the divinity of
Christ, in the Trinity, in the incarnation and atonement, and in the
great Christian doctrine of regeneration; and were in piety, devotion.
Christian activity, and missionary enterprise, as well as in learning
and intellectual power and attainments, inferior to none in the best
ages of the church, and were greatly superior to those by whom, in after
ages, they were condemned and anathematized. From two theological
schools there went forth an opposition to the doctrine of eternal
punishment, which had its ground in a deeper Christian interest;
inasmuch as the doctrine of a universal restoration was closely
connected with the entire dogmatic systems of both these schools, namely
that of Origen (Alexandrian), and the school of Antioch.\" \"Three at
least of the greatest of the ancient schools of Christian theology ---
the schools of Alexandria, Antioch and Csesarea --- leaned on this
subject to the views of Origen, not in their details, but in their
general hopefulness.... The fact that even these Origenistic fathers
were able, with perfect honesty, to use the current phraseology, shows
that such phraseology was at least capable of a different interpretation
from that (now) commonly put upon it.\" The school in Northern Africa
favored the doctrine of endless punishment; that in Asia Minor an-
nihilation. The two in Alexandria and Caesarea were Universalistic of
the school of Origen; those at Antioch and Edessa were Universalistic of
the school of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodore of Tarsus. \"Decidedly
the most powerful minds (300 to 400 AD) adopted the doctrine of
universal restoration, and those who did not adopt it entered into no
controversy about it with those who did. In the African school all this
was reversed. From the very beginning they took strong ground in favor
of the doctrine of eternal punishment, as an essential part of a great
system of law of which God was the center.\"[^271]

It should be noted, however, that the schools in Asia Minor and Northern
Africa, where annihilation and endless punishment were taught, were not
strictly divinity schools, but mere seminaries.

The one school out of the six in Christendom that taught endless
punishment was in Africa, and the doctrine was derived by Latins from
misunderstanding a foreign language, through mistranslations of the
original Greek Scriptures, and was obtained by infusing the virus of
Roman secularism into the simplicity of Christianity. Maine in his
\"Ancient Law\" attributes the difference between Eastern and Western
theology to this cause. The student of primitive Christianity will see
that Tertullian, Cyprian, Minucius Felix, down to Augustine, were
influenced by these causes, and created the theological travesty that
ruled the Christian world for dark and sorrowful centuries.

On this point (that Origen\'s views were general) Neale observes: \"In
reading the works of Origen, we are not to consider his tenets and
opinions as those of one isolated doctor; --- they are rather an
embodiment of the doctrines handed down in the Catechetical school of
Alexandria. And this school was the type, or model, according to which
the mind of the Alexandrine church was cast; the philosophy of Pantaenus
descended to Clemens, --- and from him it was caught by Origen.\"[^272]

## Origen Misrepresented.

From these facts it is easily seen that the heresies of which Origen was
accused did not touch the doctrine of universal restoration. They were
for teaching inequality between the persons of the Trinity, the
pre-existence of the human soul, denying the resurrection of the body,
affirming that wicked angels will not suffer endless punishment, and
that all souls will be absorbed into the Infinite Fountain whence they
sprang, like drops falling into the sea. This latter accusation was a
perversion of his teaching that God will be "all in all." Some of these
doctrines are only found in alleged quotations in the works of his
opponents, as Jerome and others who wrote against him. His language was
sometimes misunderstood, and oftener ignorantly or purposely perverted.
Many quotations are from works of his not in existence. Interpolations
and alterations were made by his enemies in his works even during his
lifetime, as he complained. Epiphanius \"attacked Origen in Jerusalem
after he was dead, and tried to make Bishop John denounce him. Failing
here he tried to compel Jerome, through fear for his reputation for
orthodoxy, to do the same, and succeeded so far as to disgrace Jerome
forever for his meanness, and cowardice, and double dealing. Then
Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, came to his aid in anathematizing
Origen. He called a synod AD 399, in which he condemned Origen and
anathematized all who should read his works.\" \"After this, Epiphanius
died. But his followers pursued the same work in his spirit, until
Origen was condemned again by Justinian;\" this time for his
Universalism, but, as will be seen hereafter, the church did not sustain
Justinian\'s attack.[^273]

### Dr. Pond's Misrepresentation of Origen.

The reprehensible practices to which the *odium theologicum* has
impelled good men, is illustrated by Dr. Enoch Pond, professor in Bangor
Theological Seminary. Dis-pleased with the wonderfully candid statements
of Dr. Edward Beecher, in his articles in \"The Christian Union,\"
afterwards contained in \"History of the Doctrine of Future
Retribution,\" he reviewed the articles in the same paper, and in order
to convict Dr. Beecher of inaccuracy, Dr. Pond quotes from Crombie\'s
translation of Rufinus\'s Latin version instead of from Crombie\'s
rendering of the actual Greek of Origen, and this, too, when not only
does Rufinus confess that he has altered the sense but in the very book
(III) from which Dr. Pond quotes is Crombie\'s translation of the Greek,
and the following note from Crombie is at the beginning of the chapter:
\"The whole of this chapter has been preserved in the original Greek,
which is literally translated in corresponding portions on each page, so
that the differences between Origen\'s own words and the amplifications
and alterations of the paraphrase of Rufinus may be at once patent to
the reader.\" It almost seems that there is a fatality attendant upon
all hostile critics who deal with Origen. The injustice he received in
life seems to have dogged his name in every age.

The manner in which theological questions were settled and creeds
established in those days, is shown by Athanasius. He says that when the
Emperor Constantius at the council of Milan, AD 355, commanded the
bishops to subscribe against Athanasius and they replied that there was
no ecclesiastical canon to that effect, the Emperor said, \"Whatever I
will, let that be esteemed a canon.\"

## Universalism in Good Repute in the Fifth Century.

AD 402, when Epiphanius came from Cyprus to Constantinople with a
synodical decree condemning Origen\'s books without excommunicatmg
Origen, he declined Chrysostom\'s invitation to lodge at the Episcopal
palace, as Chrysostom was a friend and advocate of Origen. He urged the
clergy of the city to sign the decree, but, Socrates says, \"many
refused, among them Theotinus, Bishop of Scythia, who said, \'I choose
not, Epiphanius, to insult the memory of one who ended his life piously
long ago; nor dare I be guilty of so impious an act, as that of
condemning what our predecessors by no means rejected; and especially
when I know of no evil doctrine contained in Origen\'s books.... Those
who attempt to fix a stigma on these writings are unconsciously casting
a dishonor upon the sacred volume whence their principles are drawn.\'
Such was the reply which Theotinus, a prelate, eminent for his piety and
rectitude of life, made to Epiphanius.\" In the next chapter (xiii),
Socrates states that only worthless characters decried Origen. Among
them he mentions Methodius, Eustathius, Apollinaris and Theophilus, as
\"four revilers,\" whose \"censure was his commendation.\" Socrates was
born about AD 380, and his book continues Eusebius\'s history to AD 445,
and he records what he received from those who knew the facts. This
makes it clear that while Origen\'s views were rejected by some, they
were in good repute by the most and the best, two hundred years after
his death.

Even Augustine admits that \"some, nay, very many\" (*nonnulli, quam
plurimi*), pity with human feeling, the everlasting punishment of the
damned, and do not believe that it is so.\"[^274] The kind of people
thus believing are described by Doederlein, \"The more highly
distinguished in Christian antiquity any one was for learning, so much
the more did he cherish and defend the hope of future torments sometime
ending.\"

## Different Opinions on Human Destiny.

Previous to AD 200 three different opinions were held among Christians
--- endless punishment, annihilation, and universal salvation; but, so
far as the literature of the times shows, the subject was never one of
controversy, and the last-named doctrine prevailed most, if the
assertions of it in literature are any test of its acceptance by the
people. For a hundred and fifty years, AD 250 to 400, though Origen and
his heresies on many points are frequently attacked and condemned, there
is scarcely a whisper on record against his Universalism. On the other
hand, to be called an Origenist was a high honor, from 260 to 290. AD
300 on, the doctrine of endless punishment began to be more explicitly
stated, notably by Arnobius and Lactantius. And thenceforward to 370,
while some of the fathers taught endless punishment, and others
annihilation, the doctrine of most is not stated. One fact, however, is
conspicuous: though all kinds of heresy were attacked, Universalism was
not considered sufficiently heretical to entitle it to censure.[^275]

# 12. The Eulogists of Origen.

This chief Universalist of the centuries immediately succeeding the
apostles was, by general consent, the most erudite and saintly of all
the Christian fathers. Historians, scholars, critics, men of all shades
of thought and opinion emulate one another in exalting his name and
praising his character. This volume could be filled with their
eulogiums.

Says one of the most judicious historians: \"If any man deserves to
stand first in the catalogue of saints and martyrs, and to be annually
held up as an example to Christians, this is the man, for except the
apostles of Jesus Christ, and their companions, I know of no one among
all those enrolled and honored as saints who excel him in virtue and
holiness.\"[^276]

A discriminating critic declares: \"His work upon the text of Scripture
alone would entitle Origen to undying gratitude. There has been no truly
great man in the church who did not love him a little.\"[^277]

Bunsen remarks: \"Origen\'s death is the real end of free Christianity,
and in particular, of free intellectual theology.\"[^278]

## The Tribute of Scholars.

The learned author of \"The Martyrs and Apologists\" truthfully
observes: \"Origen never swerved from this Christian magnanimity, and he
remains the model of the theologian persecuted by haughty bigotry.
Gentle as Fenelon under hierarchical anathemas, he maintained his
convictions without faltering, and neither retracted nor rebelled. We
may well say with the candid Tillemont that although such a man might
hold heretical opinions he could not be a heretic, since he was utterly
free from that spirit which constitutes the guilt of heresy.\"[^279]

Canon Westcott writes: "He examines with a reverence, an insight, a
grandeur of feeling never surpassed, the questions of the inspiration
and the interpretation of the Bible. The intellectual value of the work
may best be characterized by one fact: a single sentence taken from it
was quoted by Butler as containing the germ of his 'Analogy.' After
sixteen hundred years we have not yet made good the positions which he
marked out as belonging to the domain of Christian philosophy.... His
whole life was \'one unbroken prayer\' to use his own language of what
an ideal life should be.\"[^280]

The sober historian Lardner records only a candid appreciation of the
man when he says: \"He had the happiness of uniting different
accomplishments, being at once the greatest preacher and the most
learned and voluminous writer of the age; nor is it easy to say which is
most admirable, his learning or his virtue.\"[^281]

Plumptre vies with Origen\'s other eulogists, and Farrar in all his
remarkable books can never say enough in his praise. A brief extract
from him will suffice: \"The greatest of all the fathers, the most
apostolic man since the days of the apostles, the father who on every
branch of study rendered to the church the deepest and widest services
--- the immortal Origen.... The first writer, the profoundest thinker,
the greatest educator, the most laborious critic, the most honored
preacher, the holiest confessor of his age. We know of no man in the
whole Christian era, except St. Paul, who labored so incessantly, and
rendered to the church such inestimable services. We know of no man,
except St. Paul, who had to suffer from such black and bitter
ingratitude. He, the converter of the heathen, the strengthener of the
martyrs, the profoundest of Christian teachers, the greatest and most
learned of the interpreters of Scripture --- he to whom kings and
bishops and philosophers had been proud to listen --- he who had refuted
the ablest of all the assailants of Christianity --- he who had founded
the first school of Biblical exegesis and Biblical philology --- he who
had done more for the honor and the knowledge of the Oracles of God not
only than all his assailants (for that is not saying much), but than all
the then bishops and writers of the church put together --- he who had
known the Scriptures from infancy, who had vainly tried to grasp in
boyhood the crown of martyrdom, who had been the honored teacher of
saints, who had been all his life long a confessor --- he in the very
errors of whose life was more of nobleness than in the whole lives of
his assailants, --- who had lived a life more apostolic, who did more
and suffered more for the truth of Christ than any man after the first
century of our era, and whose accurately measurable services stand all
but unapproachable by all the centuries --- I, for one, will never
mention the name of Origen without the love, and the admiration, and the
reverence due to one of the greatest and one of the best of the saints
of God.\"

## A Catholic Eulogy.

Even modern Catholics --- in spite of the ban of pope and council ---
join the great army of Origen\'s eulogists. Says the *Catholic World*:

"Alexandria, the cradle of Eastern genius at that time, became the
Christian Thermopylae, and Origen the Christian Leonidas. It was he who
headed the forces, and, by the splendor of his genius, prepared in his
school illustrious men to lead on the van. He vindicated the truth from
calumny, supported it by facts, disengaged it from the sophisms in which
enemies had obscured it, and held it up to view in all its natural
beauty and attraction...Heathens were delighted with his language, full
of unction and charm, and the literati of the age, who had been lost in
the intricacies of Aristotle, the obscurities of Plato, and the
absurdities of Epicurus, wondered at the young Christian
philosopher.\"[^282]

Referring to the hard words that most advocates of universal redemption
who are past middle life have received, Rev. Edward Beecher, D. D.,
declares, in his *History of the Doctrine of Future Retribution*: \"An
evil spirit was developed at that time in putting down Origen which has
ever since poisoned the church of all denominations. It has been as a
leprosy in all Christendom. Nor is this all: measures were then resorted
to for the suppression of error which exerted a deadly hostility against
all free investigation, from the influence of which the church universal
has not yet recovered.\"

The Encyclopedia Britannica, article Origen, (Prof. Adolf Harnack),
voices the conclusions of the scholarly world:

\"Of all the theologians of the ancient church, with the possible
exception of Augustine, Origen is the most distinguished and the most
influential. He is the father of the church\'s science; he is the
founder of a theology which was brought to perfection in the Fourth and
Fifth Centuries, and which still retained the stamp of his genius when
in the Sixth Century it disowned its author. It was Origen who created
the dogmatic of the church and laid the foundations of the scientific
criticism of the Old and New Testaments. He could not have been what he
was unless two generations before him had labored at the problem of
finding an intellectual expression and a philosophic basis for
Christianity: (Justin, Tatian, Athenagoras, Pantaenus, Clement). But
their attempts, in comparison with his, are like a schoolboy\'s essays
beside the finished work of a master.... By proclaiming the
reconciliation of science with the Christian faith, of the highest
culture with the Gospel, Origen did more than any other man to win the
Old World to the Christian religion. But he entered into no diplomatic
compromises; it was his deepest and most solemn conviction that the
sacred oracles of Christendom embraced all the ideals of antiquity. His
character was as transparent as his life was blameless; there are few
church fathers whose biography leaves so pure an impression on the
reader. The atmosphere around him was a dangerous one for a philosopher
and theologian to breathe, but he kept his spiritual health unimpaired
and even his sense of truth suffered less injury than was the case with
most of his contemporaries.... Orthodox theology has never, in any of
the confessions, ventured beyond the circle which the mind of Origen
first measured out.\"

We conclude these eulogies, which might be multiplied indefinitely, by
giving the high authority of **Max Muller**: "Origen was as honest as a
Christian as he was as a philosopher, and it was this honesty which made
Christianity victorious in the Third Century, and will make it
victorious again whenever it finds supporters who are determined not to
sacrifice their philosophical convictions to their religious faith or
their religious faith to their philosophical convictions.... If we
consider the time in which he lived, and study the testimony which his
contemporaries bore of his character, we may well say of him, as of
others who have been misjudged by posterity:

> '*Denn wer den Besten seiner Zeit genug gelebt,\
> Der hat genug gelebt fur alle Zeiten.*'"[^283]

If any man since the death of Paul should rank as the patron saint of
the Universalist church, it is the greatest and best of all the ancient
fathers, Origen Adamantius.

## Note.

It has been asserted that Origen did not actually teach the ultimate
salvation of all souls, because he insisted that the human will is
eternally free, and therefore it is argued that he must have held that
souls may repent and be saved, and sin and fall forever. But this is not
true, for Origen taught that at some period in the future, love and
holiness will be so absorbed by all souls that, though, theoretically,
they will be free, they will so will that lapse will be impossible.
Jerome, Justinian, Dr. **Pond**, and others are explicitly confuted by
the great scholar and saint. In his comments on Romans 6:9, 10, he says:
\"The apostle decides, by an absolute decision, that now Christ dies no
more, in order that those who live together with him may be secure of
the endlessness of their life.... Free-will indeed remains, but the
power of the cross suffices for all orders, and all ages, past and to
come. And that free-will will not lead to sin, is plain, because love
never fails, and when God is loved with all the heart, and soul, and
mind, and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves, where is the place
for sin?\"

In his great work *De Principiis*, he declares: \"The nature of this
body of ours will be changed into the glory of a spiritual body, in
which state we are to believe that it will remain always and immutably
by the will of the Creator,\" etc. Though Origen insisted that the human
will must forever be free, he did not admit that the soul could abuse
its freedom by continuing forever to lapse into sin.

# 13. A Third Century Group.

While we mourn that so little of the literature of the early days of our
religion remains, the wonder is that we have so much, rather than so
little. The persecutions of Decius and Diocletian --- especially of the
latter --- were most unrelenting towards Christian books.[^284]

"The volumes which escaped from the perils of those days were like
brands snatched from the fire."

"A little dust --- precious, indeed, as gold --- in a few sepulchral
urns, is all that now remains."

And later, the burning of the Alexandrine library by the Arabs, the
destructive persecutions of heretics, the ban of council, and the curse
of pope and priest, in the church\'s long eclipse, destroyed innumerable
volumes, so that there is ample reason to believe that, could we inspect
all that Clement, Origen and others wrote, in the original Greek,
untampered with, we should have pages where we now have sentences
avowing Universalism. Occasionally an ancient volume is yet found,
accidentally buried, as was the Philosophumena of Hippolytus, formerly
attributed to Origen, discovered by a learned Greek in a monastery on
Mount Athos, in the year 1842. Of the ten books contained in the volume,
the second, the third, and the beginning of the fourth are gone.

## Hippolytus.

Hippolytus (about 220 AD) enumerates and comments on thirty-two
heresies, but universal restoration is not named among them.[^285] And
yet, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen --- then living --- were
everywhere regarded as the great teachers of the church, and their view
of man\'s future destiny was generally prevalent, according to
Augustine, Jerome and others. It could not then have been regarded as a
"heresy" or Hippolytus would have named it. What a force there is in the
fact that not one of those who wrote against the heresies of their times
ever name universal salvation as one of them! Hippolytus mentions
thirty-two. Epiphanius wrote his *Panarion* and epitomized it in his
*Anacephalaeosis* or *Recapitulation*, but not one of the heresy-hunters
includes our faith in his maledictions. Can there be stronger evidence
than this fact that the doctrine was not then heretical?

### Dean Wordsworth's Error.

It is curious to notice how the mind of a theologian can be prejudiced.
Dean Wordsworth in his translation of Hippolytus gives the language of
that contemporary of Origen, to show that the former had no sympathy
with the broad faith of the latter. He quotes Hippolytus thus: \"The
coming malediction of the judgment of fire, and the dark and rayless
aspect of tartarus, not irradiated by the voice of the Word, and the
surge of the ever-flowing lake, generating fire, and the eye of
tartarean avenging angels ever fixed in malediction,\" etc. The Dean
unwarrantably, because inaccurately, translates *kolaston* "avenging," a
meaning it does not possess. It is rendered punish, chastise, correct,
but never carries the sense of revenge. Furthermore, disregarding the
fact that the acknowledged Universalist fathers denounce the sinner with
words as intense as is the above language, which may be literally
fulfilled and yet restoration ensue beyond it all, the Dean renders the
very next paragraph thus: "You will have your body immortal[^286] and
incorruptible,[^287] together with your soul"[^288] (life). Now had
Hippolytus intended to teach the absolutely interminable duration of the
"tartarean fire," would he not have used these stronger terms,
*aphtharton* and *athanaton*, which are never employed in the New
Testament to teach limited duration, and is not the fact that he used
the weaker word to describe punishment, evidence that he did not in this
passage in the *Philosophumena* intend to teach the sinner\'s endless
torment?

Not less surprising is the language of Dean Wordsworth, and his
misreading of the facts of history, when he comments on the harsh and
bitter tone of Hippolytus, in his treatment of heretics, in the
*Philosophumena*. Contrasting the acrid temper of Hippolytus with the
sweetness of Origen, Dean Wordsworth says:

"The opinion of Origen with regard to future punishments is well known.
The same feelings which induced him to palliate the errors of heretics,
beguiled him into exercising his ingenuity in tampering with the
declarations of Scripture concerning the eternal duration of the future
punishment of sin. Thus false charity betrayed him into heresy."[^289]

This is a sad reversal of cause and effect. Why not say that the sublime
fact of God\'s goodness resulting in universal salvation, created in
Origen\'s heart that generous charity and divine sweetness that caused
him to look with pity rather than with anger on human error, in
imitation of the God he worshiped?

## Theophilus. 

Theophilus of Antioch, who wrote about 180 AD, and was bishop of
Antioch, speaks of *aionian* torments, and *aionian* fire, but he must
have used the terms as did Origen and the other ancient Universalists,
for he says: \"For just as a vessel which, after it has been made, has
some flaw, is remade or remolded, that it may become new and bright, so
it comes to man by death. For in some way or other he is broken up, that
he may come forth in the resurrection whole, I mean spotless, and
righteous, and immortal.\"[^290]

## Tertullian. 

Tertullian (Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus) was born in
Carthage, Africa, about 160 AD, and died 220 AD. He had a fine Pagan
education in Roman law and rhetoric, but lived a heathen into mature
manhood, and confesses that his life had been one of vice and
licentiousness.[^291] Converted to Christianity he became in later years
a presbyter. He lived a moral and religious life after his conversion,
but the heathen doctrines he retained rendered his spirit harsh and
bitter. About 202 AD he joined the Montanists, a schismatic, ascetic
sect. Those who sympathized with him were known as Tertullianists as
late as the Fifth Century. His abilities were great, but, as Schaff
says, he was the opposite of the equally genial, less vigorous, but more
learned and comprehensive Origen.

### Advocates Endless Torment.

Tertullian was the first of the Africo-Latin writers who commanded the
public ear, and there is strong ground for supposing that since
Tertullian quotes the sacred writings perpetually and copiously, the
earliest of those many Latin versions noticed by Augustine and on which
Jerome grounded his vulgate, were African.... "Africa, not Rome, gave
birth to Latin Christianity."

A learned writer states: \"His own authority is small, he was not a
sound divine, became heterodox, and fell away into one of the heresies
of his times.\"[^292]

The fountain of Paganism in the heart of Tertullian discharged its
noxious waters into the larger reservoir in the mighty brain of
Augustine, and thence in the Sixth Century it submerged Christendom with
a deluge that lasted for a thousand years, --- now happily subsiding, to
give place to those primal Christian truths that were in the hearts of
Clement and Origen. Tertullian and Origen were as unlike as the churches
they represent, --- the Latin and the Greek. Narrow, Pagan, cruel,
unchristian, the dark path of the Tertullian-Augustine type of
Christianity through the centuries is strewn with the wrecks of
ignorance and sorrow. He retained his heathen notions and gave them a
Christian label. He makes the Underworld, like the heathen, divided by
an impassable gulf into two parts. The abode of the righteous is *sinus
Abrahoe*, that of the wicked *ignis* or *inferi*. Tertullian was
probably the first of the fathers to assert that the torments of the
lost will be of equal duration with the happiness of the saved. "God
will recompense his worshipers with life eternal; and cast the profane
into a fire equally perpetual and unintermitted."[^293]

In Tertullian\'s *Apology* are fifty arguments for the Christian
religion, but not once does he state that endless punishment was one of
the doctrines of the church. He seems to have been half-inclined to the
truth, for he speaks of the sinner as being able, after death, to pay
"the uttermost farthing."

Tertullian illustrates the effect of the doctrine he advocated in his
almost infernal exultations over the future torments of the enemies of
the church. "How I shall admire, how I shall laugh, how exult," he cries
with fiendish glee, "to see the torments of the wicked." ... "I shall
then have a better chance of hearing the tragedians call louder in their
own distress; of seeing the actors more lively in the dissolving flame;
of beholding the charioteer glowing in his fiery chariot; of seeing
their wrestlers tossing on fiery waves instead of in their gymnasium,"
etc.[^294] Referring to the "spectacles" he anticipates, he says: "Faith
grants us to enjoy them even now, by lively anticipation; but what shall
the reality be of those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard,
nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive? They may well
compensate, surely, the circus and both amphitheaters and all the
spectacles the world can offer."

No wonder **De Pressense** says, "This joy in the anticipation of the
doom of the enemies of Christ is altogether alien to the spirit of the
Gospel; that mocking laugh, ringing across the abyss which opens to
swallow up the persecutors," etc. But why "alien," if a God of love
ordained, and the gentle Christ executes, the appalling doom? Was not
Tertullian nearer the mood a Christian should cultivate than are those
who are shocked by his description, if it is true? **Max Muller** calls
attention to the fact that Tertullian and the Latin fathers were obliged
to cripple the Greek Christian thought by being destitute of even words
to express it. He has to use two words, *verbum* and *ratio*, to express
Logos.\" Not having Greek tools to work with,\" he says, \"his verbal
picture often becomes blurred.\"

**Hase** says that Tertullian was a "gloomy, fiery character, who
conquered for Christianity, out of the Punic Latin, a literature in
which ingenious rhetoric, a wild imagination, a gross, sensuous
perception of the ideal, profound feeling, and a juridical understanding
struggled with each other."

## Ambrose of Alexandria. 

Ambrose of Alexandria, 180-250 AD, was of a noble and wealthy family.
Meeting Origen he accepted Christianity as taught by the *magister
orientis*, and urged and stimulated his great teacher to write his many
books, and used his fortune to further them. Thus we owe generally, it
is said, nearly all the exegetical works of Origen to Ambrose\'s
influence and money; and especially his commentary on St. John. It was
at his request also that Origen composed his greatest work, the answer
to Celsus. He left no writings of his own except some letters, but his
devotedness to Origen, and his agency in promoting the publication of
his works, should convince us that Origen\'s views are substantially his
own.[^295]

## The Manichaeans. 

The Manichaeans, followers of Mani, were a considerable sect that had a
following over a large part of Christendom from 277 to 500 AD.

Eusebius is very bitter in describing the sect and its founder. "He was
a madman," and his "ism, patched up of many faults and impious heresies,
long since extinct."

Socrates calls it "a kind of heathenish Christianity," and says it is
composed of a union of Christianity with the doctrines of Empedocles and
Pythagoras.

Lardner quotes the evident misrepresentations of Eusebius and Socrates
and exposes their inaccuracies. A large amount of literature was
expended on some of their doctrines, but not on their denial of endless
torment. In fact, Didymus the Blind, as well as Augustine, seems to have
opposed their errors, though the "merciful doctor" gives them, as
Lardner says, "no hard names," while the father of Calvinism treats them
with characteristic severity, ignoring what he himself acknowledges
elsewhere, that for eight or nine years he accepted their tenets.

Referring to the vile practices and doctrines with which they are
charged, Lardner says: "The thing is altogether incredible, especially
when related of people who by profession were Christians; who believed
that Jesus Christ was a perfect model of all virtues; who acknowledged
the reasonableness and excellence of the precepts of the Gospel, and
that the essence of religion lies in obeying them." The consensus of
ancient authorities proves the Manichaeans to have been an unpopular but
reputable Christian sect.

### Manichean Doctrines.

Mani was a Persian, a scholar, and a Christian. Beginning his debate
with Archelaus, he says: "I, brethren, am a disciple and an apostle of
Jesus Christ;" and he and his followers everywhere claim to be disciples
of our Lord. Among their dogmas, was one that denied endless existence
to the devil, who was then considered to be almost the fourth person in
the popular Godhead, --- they repudiated the resurrection of the body
and clearly taught universal restoration. Lardner quotes Mani in his
dispute with Archelaus, as saying: "All sorts of souls will be saved,
and the lost sheep will be brought back to the fold." And after quoting
their adversaries as stating that the Manichaeans taught the eternity of
hell torments, Lardner says, quoting Beausobre: "All which means no more
than a privation of happiness, or a labor and task, rather than a
punishment. Indeed it is reasonable to think the Manichaeans should
allow but very few, if any, souls to be lost and perish forever. That
could not be reckoned honorable to the Deity, considering how souls were
sent into matter."[^296] Lardner is certainly within bounds when he
says: "But it is doubtful whether they believed the eternity of hell
torments."

### Prof. Shedd's Historical Inaccuracy.

The astonishing way in which, as Wendell Phillips once said, "what
passes for history," is written, may be seen in Professor William G. T.
Shedd\'s *History of Christian Doctrine*. He says: "The punishment
inflicted upon the lost was regarded by the fathers of the ancient
church, with very few exceptions, as endless.... The only exception to
the belief in the eternity of future punishment in the ancient church
appears in the Alexandrine school. Their denial of the doctrine sprang
logically out of their anthropology. Clement of Alexandria, and Origen,
we have seen, asserted with great earnestness the tenet of a plenary and
inalienable power in the human will to overcome sin. The destiny of the
soul is thus placed in the soul itself. The power of free will cannot be
lost, and if not exerted in this world, it still can be in the next; and
under the full light of the eternal world; and under the stimulus of
suffering there experienced, nothing is more probable than that it will
be exerted. The views of Origen were almost wholly confined to this
school. Faint traces of a belief in the remission of punishments in the
future world are visible in the writings of Didymus of Alexandria, and
in Gregory of Nyssa.... With these exceptions, the ancient church held
that the everlasting destiny of the human soul is decided in this
earthly state.\"[^297]

The reader who will turn to the sketches of Didymus and Gregory will
discover what Prof. Shedd denominates "faint traces," and in the
multitudes of quotations from others of the fathers who were not of the
Alexandrine school, he will see how utterly inaccurate is this religious
historian. Numerous quotations flatly contradict his assertion. The
verbal resemblance of Dr. Shedd\'s language to that of Hagenbach, cannot
be wholly due to accident.[^298] Prof. Shedd, however, contradicts what
Schaff and Hagenbach declare to be the truth of history. He says that
the Alexandrine school was the only exception to a universal belief in
endless punishment, except the faint traces in Gregory of Nyssa; while
Hagenbach insists that Gregory is more explicit, and Neander affirms
that the school of Antioch as well as that of Alexandria, were
Universalistic. Furthermore, Prof. Shedd does not seem to have
remembered the words he had written with his own pen in his translation
of Guerike\'s *Church History*:[^299] \"It is noticeable that the
exegetico-grammatical school of Antioch, as well as the allegorizing
Alexandrian, adopted and maintained the doctrine of restoration.\"

Says Hagenbach, \"Some faint traces of a belief in the final remission
of punishments in the world to come are to be found in those writings of
Didymus of Alexandria, which are yet extant.... Gregory of Nyssa speaks
more distinctly upon this point, pointing out the corrective design of
the punishments inflicted upon the wicked.\" Hagenbach expressly places
Gregory and Didymus as differing, while Shedd makes them agree. But
Neander declares: "From two theological schools there went forth an
opposition to the doctrine of everlasting punishment, which had its
ground in a deeper Christian interest; inasmuch as the doctrine of a
universal restoration was closely connected with the entire dogmatic
systems of both these schools, namely, that of Origen, and the school of
Antioch."[^300]

# 14. Minor Authorities.

## Several Fathers.

Among the celebrated fathers who have left no record of their views of
human destiny, but who, from their positions, and the relations they
sustained, must, beyond all rational doubt, have been Universalists, may
be mentioned Athenodorus, who was a student of Origen\'s, and a bishop
in Pontus; Heraclas, a convert of Origen\'s, his assistant and successor
in the school at Alexandria, and bishop of Alexandria; Firmilian, a
scholar of Origen\'s, and bishop of Caesarea; and Palladius, bishop in
Asia Minor.

## Firmilian.

Firmilian, though he wrote little, and is therefore not much known, was
certainly very conspicuous in his day. His theology may be gauged from
the fact that "he held Origen in such high honor that he sometimes
invited him into his own district for the benefit of the churches, and
even journeyed to Judea to visit him, spending long periods of time with
him in order to improve in his knowledge of theology."[^301] He was a
warm friend of Dionysius, Cyprian, and Gregory Thaumaturgus, and was
chosen president of the Council of Antioch.

## Dionysius.

Dionysius --- styled by Eusebius "the great bishop of Alexandria," born
195 AD --- died 265 --- became the head of the Catechetical school in
Alexandria in 231 AD, and succeeded Heraclas as bishop of Alexandria in
248 AD. He was a constant friend of Origen, and after the opposition to
him had begun, Dionysius addressed him "On Persecution," --- 259 AD ---
and wrote a letter in his praise after his death, to Theotecnus, bishop
of Caesarea, 265 AD. Neale says: "The loss of the writings of Dionysius
is one of the greatest that had been suffered by ecclesiastical
history."[^302]

## Theognostus and Pierius.

Theognostus and Pierius were Alexandrine catechists after the death of
Dionysius. The fact that Photius reprobates the doctrine, while he
praises the eloquence, of Theognostus, as does Athanasius, indicates
that these eminent scholars were of the faith of their master. Pierius,
in fact, must have been, for he was called the "Second Origen,"
(*Origenes Junior*).

## Gregory Thaumaturgus.

Gregory Thaumaturgus --- 210-270 AD --- in his panegyric on Origen,
ascribes his own intellectual and religious birth and life to his
master, and gives the best description extant of the methods and ability
of that most eminent of all the Christian teachers and fathers. Their
mutual regard is shown by surviving letters from both. If nothing were
in existence from Gregory, expressive of his Universalist sentiments,
the fact that he was Origen\'s pupil for five years, and delivered his
famous encomium on his teacher, would go far to establish his acceptance
of the doctrine. He says: "My guardian angel, on our arrival at
Caesarea, handed us over to the care and tuition of Origen, that leader
of all, who speaks in undertones to God\'s dear prophets, and suggests
to them all their prophecy and their mystic and divine word, has so
honored this man Origen as a friend, as to appoint him to be their
interpreter." As Origen spoke, Gregory tells us he kindled a love "in my
heart I had not known before. This love induced me to give up country
and friends, the aims which I had proposed to myself, the study of law
of which I was proud. I had but one passion, one philosophy, and the
god-like man who directed me in the pursuit of it." He became bishop of
Caesarea and was regarded as the incarnation of the orthodoxy of his
times. Almost nothing of his writings has survived, but Rufinus, the
apologist and defender of Origen, gives a passage, says Allin, showing
that he taught the divine truth he learned from his master.

## Pamphilus.

Pamphilus, 250-309 AD, was one of the greatest scholars of his times. He
founded the famous library of Caesarea, which contained some of the most
ancient codices of the New Testament and also Origen\'s books in their
original Greek. Pamphilus wrote an *Apology* and defense of Origen, with
whom he was in full sympathy. Eusebius wrote the biography of Pamphilus
in three books. Unfortunately it has been lost, so that nothing survives
of the works of this eminent Christian writer and scholar. The esteem in
which he was held by Eusebius may be gauged from the fact that after his
death Eusebius, "the father of ecclesiastical history," changed his own
name to "Pamphilus\'s Eusebius." The *Apology* contained "very many
testimonies of fathers earlier than Origen in favor of
restitution."[^303] How lamentable that these "testimonies" are lost!
What light they would shed on early opinion on the great theme of this
book. As Origen was born about ninety years after St. John\'s death,
these very numerous "testimonies" would carry back these doctrines very
close, or altogether to the apostolic age.

"With Pamphilus, the era of free Christian theology of the Eastern
church ends." Pamphilus, according to Eusebius was "a man who excelled
in every virtue through his whole life, whether by a renunciation and
contempt of the world, by distributing his substance among the needy, or
by a disregard of worldly expectations, and by a philosophical
deportment and self-denial. But he was chiefly distinguished above the
rest of us by his sincere devotedness to the sacred Scriptures, and by
an indefatigable industry in what he proposed to accomplish, by his
great kindness and alacrity to serve all his relatives, and all that
approached him." He copied, for the great library in Caesarea, most of
Origen\'s manuscripts, with his own hands.

## Eusebius. 

Eusebius was probably born in Caesarea. He was a friend of Origen, and
fellow-teacher with him in the Caesarean school, and published with
Pamphilus a glowing defense of Origen in six books, of which five are
lost. He also copied and edited many of his works. Dr. Beecher, in his
*History of Future Retribution*, asserts the Universalism of Eusebius,
though Dr. Ballou, in his *Ancient History* does not quote him.

On 1 Corinthians 15:28, Eusebius says: "If the subjection of the Son to
the Father means union with him, then the subjection of all to the Son
means union with him.... Christ is to subject all things to himself. We
ought to conceive of this as such a salutary subjection as that by which
the Son will be subject to him who subjects all to him."[^304] Again on
Psalm 2: "The Son breaking in pieces his enemies for the sake of
remolding them as a potter his own work, as Jer. 18:6, is to restore
them once more to their former state." Jerome distinctly says of
Eusebius: "He, in the most evident manner, acquiesced in Origen\'s
tenets." His understanding of terms is seen where he twice calls the
fire that consumed two martyrs \"unquenchable\" (*asbesto puri*).

Eusebius is as severe in describing the sinner\'s woes as Augustine
himself. He says: "Who those were (whose worm dies not) he showed in the
beginning of the prophecy, 'I have nourished and brought up children and
they have set me at nought.' He spoke darkly then of those of the Jews
who set at nought the saving grace. Which end of the ungodly our Savior
himself also appoints in the Gospel, saying to those who shall stand on
the left hand, 'Go you into the *aionian* fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels.' As then the fire is said to be *aionian*, so here
\'unquenchable,\' one and the same substance encircling them according
to the Scriptures.\"

In varied and extensive learning, and as a theologian and writer, and
most of all as an historian, Eusebius was far before most of those of
his times; and though high in the confidence of his Emperor,
Constantine, he did not make his influence contribute to his own
personal aggrandizement. He was so kind toward the Arians, with whom he
did not agree, that he was accused of Arianism by such as could not see
how one could differ from another without hating him. Most of his
writings have perished. Of course his name is chiefly immortalized by
his *Ecclesiastical History*.

## Athanasius.

Athanasius (296-373 AD). This great man was a student of Origen and
speaks of him with favor, defends him as orthodox, and quotes him as
authority. He argues for the possibility of repentance and pardon for
even the sin against the Holy Ghost. He says: "Christ captured over
again the souls captured by the devil, for that he promised in saying,
'I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.'"

On Psalm 68:18: "When, then, the whole creation shall meet the Son in
the clouds, and shall be subject to him, then, too, shall the Son
himself be subject to the Father, as being a faithful Apostle, and High
Priest of all creation, that God may be all in all."[^305]

Athanasius nominated Didymus the Blind as president of the Catechetical
school of Alexandria, where he presided sixty years, an acknowledged
Universalist, which is certainly evidence of the sympathies, if not of
the real views of Athanasius. He called Origen a "wonderful and most
laborious man," and offers no condemnation of his eschatology.

## Didymus.

Didymus, "the illustrious," the Blind, was born, it is supposed, in
Alexandria, 309 AD. He became entirely blind when four years of age and
learned to write by using tablets of wood. He knew the Scriptures by
heart, through hearing them read. He died, universally esteemed, in 395
AD. He was held to be strictly orthodox, though known to cherish the
views of Origen on universal restoration. After his death, in the
councils of 553, 680, and 787 AD, he was anathematized for advocating
Origen\'s "abominable doctrine of the transmigration of souls," but
nothing is said in condemnation of his pronounced Universalism.

Of the Descent of Christ into Hades, he says, --- as translated by
Ambrose: "In the liberation of all no one remains a captive; at the time
of the Lord\'s passion, he alone (the devil) was injured, who lost all
the captives he was keeping."[^306] Didymus argues the final remission
of punishment, and universal salvation, in comments on 1 Timothy and 1
Peter. He was condemned by name in the council of Constantinople and his
works ordered destroyed. Were they in existence no doubt many extracts
might be given. Jerome and Rufinus state that he was an advocate of
universal restoration. Yet he was honored by the best Christians of his
times. Schaff says: "Even men like Jerome, Rufinus, Palladius, and
Isadore sat at his feet with admiration." After Jerome turned against
Origen[^307] he declares that Didymus defended Origen\'s words as pious
and Catholic, words that "all churches condemn." And he adds: "In
Didymus we extol his great power of memory, and his purity of faith in
the Trinity, but on other points, as to which he unduly trusted Origen,
we draw back from him." Schaff declares him to have been a faithful
follower of Origen.

Socrates calls him "the great bulwark of the true faith," and quotes
Antony as saying: "Didymus, let not the loss of your bodily eyes
distress you; for although you are deprived of such organs as confer a
faculty of perception common to gnats and flies, you should rather
rejoice that you have eyes such as angels see with, by which the Deity
himself is discerned, and his light comprehended." According to the
great Jerome, he "surpassed all of his day in knowledge of the
Scriptures." He wrote voluminously, but very little remains.

He says: "For although the Judge at times inflicts tortures and anguish
on those who merit them, yet he who more deeply scans the reasons of
things, perceiving the purpose of his goodness, who desires to amend the
sinner, confesses him to be good."

Again he says: "As men, by giving up their sins, are made subject to him
(Christ), so too, the higher intelligences, freed by correction from
their willful sins, are made subject to him, on the completion of the
dispensation ordered for the salvation of all. God desires to destroy
evil, therefore evil is (one) of those things liable to destruction. Now
that which is of those things liable to destruction will be destroyed."
He is said by Basnage to have held to universal salvation.

These are samples of a large number of extracts that might be made from
the most celebrated of the Alexandrine school, representing the type of
theology that prevailed in the East, during almost four hundred years.
They are not from a few isolated authorities but from the most eminent
in the church, and those who gave tone to theological thought, and
shaped and gave expression to public opinion. There can be no doubt that
they are true exponents of the doctrines of their day, and that man\'s
universal deliverance from sin was the generally accepted view of human
destiny, prevalent in the Alexandrine church from the death of the
apostles to the end of the Fourth Century. And in this connection it may
be repeated that the Catechetical school in Alexandria was taught by
Anaxagoras, Pantaenus, Origen, Clement, Heraclas, Dionysius, Pierius,
Theognostus, Peter Martyr, Arius and Didymus, all Universalists, so far
as is known. The last teacher in the Alexandrine school was Didymus.
After his day it was removed to Sida in Pamphylia, and soon after it
ceased to exist.[^308]

The historian Gieseler records that "the belief in the inalienable
capability of improvement in all rational beings, and the limited
duration of future punishment, was so general, even in the West, and
among the opponents of Origen that, whatever may be said of its not
having risen without the influence of Origen\'s school, it had become
entirely independent of his system." So that the doctrine may be said to
have prevailed all over Christendom, East and West, among "orthodox" and
heterodox alike.

## Epiphanius. 

Epiphanius, a narrow-minded, credulous, violent-tempered, but sincere
man, 310-404 AD, was bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, 367 AD. He bitterly
opposed Origen, and denounced him for a multitude of errors, but he does
not hint that his views of restoration were objectionable to himself, or
to the church, at the time he wrote. He "began those miserable
Origenistic controversies in which monkish fanaticism combined with
personal hatreds and jealousies to brand with heresy the greatest
theologian of the primitive church."[^309] To his personal hatred and
bitterness is due much, if not most, of the opposition to Origenism that
began in the latter part of the Fourth Century. In an indictment of
eighteen counts, published in 380 AD, we find what possibly may have
been the first intended censure of Universalism on record, though it
will be observed that its animus is not against the salvation of all
mankind, but against the salvability of evil spirits. Epiphanius says:
"That which he strove to establish I know not whether to laugh at or
grieve. Origen, the renowned doctor, dared to teach that the devil is
again to become what he originally was --- to return to his former
dignity. Oh, wickedness! Who is so mad and stupid as to believe that
holy John Baptist, and Peter, and John the Apostle and Evangelist, and
that Isaiah also and Jeremiah, and the rest of the prophets, are to
become fellow-heirs with the devil in the kingdom of Heaven!"[^310] The
reader can here see the possible origin of the familiar argument of
recent times.

In his book against heresies, *The Panarion*, this "hammer of heretics"
names eighty; but universal salvation is not among them. The
sixty-fourth is "Origenism," but, as is seen elsewhere in this volume,
that stood for other dogmas of Origen and not for his Universalism.

## Methodius

Methodius, bishop of Tyre (293 AD). His writings, like so many of the
works of the early fathers, have been lost, but Epiphanius and Photius
have preserved extracts from his work on the resurrection.

He says: "God, for this cause, pronounced him (man) mortal, and clothed
him with mortality, that man might not be an undying evil, in order that
by the dissolution of the body, sin might be destroyed root and branch
from beneath, that there might not be left even the smallest particle of
root, from which new shoots of sin might break forth."

Again, "Christ was crucified that he might be adored by all created
things equally, for 'unto him every knee shall bow,'" etc.

Again: "The Scriptures usually call 'destruction' the turning to the
better at some future time."

Again: "The world shall be set on fire in order to purification and
renewal."[^311]

The general drift, as well as the definite statements of the minor
authorities cited in this chapter, show the dominant sentiment of the
times.

# 15. Gregory Nazianzen.

## Bishop of Constantinople.

Gregory of Nazianzus, born 330 AD, was one of the greatest orators of
the ancient church. Gibbon sarcastically says: "The title of Saint has
been added to his name, but the tenderness of his heart, and the
elegance of his genius, reflect a more pleasing luster on the memory of
Gregory Nazianzen." The child of a Christian mother, Nonna, he was
instructed in youth in the elements of religion. He enjoyed an early
acquaintance with Basil, and in Alexandria with Athanasius. With Basil
his friendship was so strong that Gregory says it was only one soul in
two bodies. In 361 AD, he became presbyter, and in 379 he was called to
the charge of the small, divided orthodox church in Constantinople,
which had been almost annihilated by the prevalence of Arianism. He so
strengthened and increased it, that the little chapel became the
splendid "Church of the Resurrection." In 380 AD the Emperor Theodosius
deposed the Arian bishop, and transferred the cathedral to Gregory. He
was elected bishop of Constantinople in May, 381, and was president of
the Ecumenical council in Constantinople, while Gregory Nyssa added the
clauses to the Nicene creed. He resigned because of the hostility of
other bishops and passed his remaining days in religious and literary
pursuits. He died in 390 or 391 AD. He was second to Chrysostom as an
orator in the Greek church. More than this, he was one of the purest and
best of men, and his was one of the five or six greatest names in the
church\'s first five hundred years.

Prof. Schaff styles him "one of the champions of Orthodoxy."

Gregory says: "God brings the dead to life as partakers of fire or
light. But whether even all shall hereafter partake of God, let it be
elsewhere discussed."

Again he says: "I know also of a fire not cleansing[^312] but chastising
(Greek),[^313] ... unless anyone chooses even in this case to regard it
more humanely, and creditably to the Chastiser." This is a remarkable
instance of the esoteric, and well may Petavius say: "It is manifest
that in this place St. Gregory is speaking of the punishments of the
damned, and doubted whether they would be eternal, or rather to be
estimated in accordance with the goodness of God, so as at some time to
be terminated." And Farrar well observes: "If this last sentence had not
been added the passage would have been always quoted as a most decisive
proof that this eminently great father and theologian held, without any
modification, the severest form of the doctrine of endless torments."

## The Penalties of Sin.

Gregory tells us: "When you read in Scripture of God\'s being angry, or
threatening a sword against the wicked...understand this rightly, and
not wrongly...how then are these metaphors used? Figuratively. In what
way? With a view to terrifying minds of the simpler sort."

He writes again: "A few drops of blood renew the whole world, and become
for all men that which rennet is for milk, uniting and drawing us into
one." Christ is "like leaven for the entire mass, and having made that
which was damned one with himself, frees the whole from damnation." And
yet Gregory describes the penalties of sin in language as fearful as
though he did not teach restoration beyond it. He says: "That sentence
after which is no appeal, no higher judge, no defense through subsequent
work; no oil from the wise virgins or from those who sell, for the
failing lamps;...but one last fearful judgment, even more just than
formidable, yea, rather the more formidable because it is also just;
when thrones are set and the Ancient of Days sits, and books are open,
and a stream of fire sweeps...and they who have done evil to the
resurrection of judgment...(where) the torment will be, with the rest,
or rather above all the rest, to be cast off from God, and that shame in
the conscience which has no end.\"[^314]

The character of Gregory shows us the kind of mind that leans to the
larger hope, or, perhaps, the disposition that the larger hope produces.
Says Farrar: "Poet, orator, theologian; a man as great theologically as
he was personally winning[^315]... the sole man whom the church has
suffered to share that title (Theologian) with the Evangelist St.
John,... the most learned and the most eloquent bishop in one of the
most learned ages of the church, whom St. Basil called 'a vessel of
election, a deep well, a mouth of Christ;' whom Rufinus calls
'incomparable in life and doctrine.' Gregory of Nazianzus deserved the
honor of sainthood if any man has ever done, being as he was, one of the
bravest men in an age of confessors, one of the holiest men in an age of
saints." ... "In questions of eschatology he seems more or less to have
shared, though with wavering language, in some of the views of Origen,
which the church has partly adopted and partly uncondemned --- the view,
especially, that there shall be hereafter a probatory and purifying
fire, and that we may indulge a hope in the possible cessation, for
many, if not for all, of the punishments which await sin beyond the
grave. He speaks indeed far less openly than Gregory of Nyssa, of a
belief in the final restoration of all things, but even this belief lies
involved in his remarks on the prophecy of St. Paul, concerning that day
when 'God shall be all in all.'"

## Gregory's Spirit.

When Gregory and his congregation had been attacked in their church,
while celebrating our Lord\'s baptism, by the Arian rabble of
Constantinople, in consequence of the report that they were Tritheists,
Gregory heard that Theodorus was about to appeal for redress to
Theodosius, whereupon the good man wrote that while punishment might
possibly prevent recurrence of such conduct, it was better to give an
example of longsuffering. "Let us," said he, "overcome them by
gentleness, and win them by piety; let their punishment be found in
their own consciences, not in our resentment. Dry not up the fig-tree
that may yet bear fruit." The Seventh General Council called him "Father
of Fathers."

That he regarded punishment after death as limited, is sufficiently
evident from his reference to the heretical Novatians: "Let them, if
they will, walk in our way and in Christ\'s. If not, let them walk in
their own way. Perchance there they will be baptized with the fire, with
that last, that more laborious and longer baptism, which devours the
substance like hay, and consumes the lightness of all evil."[^316]

Neander says: "Gregory Nazianzen did not venture to express his own
doctrine so openly (as Gregory Nyssen) but allows it sometimes to escape
when he is speaking of eternal punishment. The Antiochan school were led
to this doctrine, not by Origen but by their own thinkings and
examination of the Scripture. They regarded the two-fold division of the
development of the creature as a general law of the universe. This led
to the final result of universal participation in the unchangeable
divine life. Hence the ἀποκατάστασις[^317] was taught by Diodorus of
Tarsus, in his treatise on the Incarnation of God, and also by
Theodorus. He applied Matt. 5:26, to prove a rule of proportion, and an
end of punishment. God would not call the wicked to rise again if they
must endure punishment without amendment."[^318]

# 16. Theodore of Mopsuestia and the Nestorians. 

Theodore of Mopsuestia was born in Antioch, 350 AD, and died 428 or 429.
He ranked next to Origen in the esteem of the ancient church. For nearly
fifty years he maintained the cause of the church in controversy with
various classes of assailants, and throughout his life his orthodoxy was
regarded as unimpeachable. He was bishop for thirty-six years and died
full of honors; but after he had been in his grave a hundred and
twenty-five years, the church had become so corrupted by heathenism that
it condemned him for heresy. He was anathematized for Nestorianism, but
his Universalism was not stigmatized. His great renown and popularity
must have caused his exalted views of God\'s character and man\'s
destiny to prevail more extensively among the masses than appears in the
surviving literature of his times.

His own words are: "The wicked who have committed evil the whole period
of their lives shall be punished till they learn that, by continuing in
sin, they only continue in misery. And when, by this means, they shall
have been brought to fear God, and to regard him with good will, they
shall obtain the enjoyment of his grace. For he never would have said,
'until you have paid the uttermost farthing,' unless we can be released
from suffering after having suffered adequately for sin; nor would he
have said, 'he shall be beaten with many stripes,' and again, 'he shall
be beaten with few stripes,' unless the punishment to be endured for sin
will have an end."[^319]

## Views Defined by Great Scholars. 

Professor E. H. Plumptre writes: "Theodore of Mopsuestia teaches that in
the world to come those who have done evil all their life long will be
made worthy of the sweetness of the divine beauty." And in the course of
a statement of Theodore\'s doctrine, Prof. Swete observes[^320] that
Theodore teaches that "the punishments of the condemned will indeed be
in their nature eternal, being such as belong to eternity and not to
time, but both reason and Scripture lead us to the conclusion that they
will be remissible upon repentance. 'Where,' he asks, 'would be the
benefit of a resurrection to such persons, if they were raised only to
be punished without end?' Moreover, Theodore\'s fundamental conception
of the mission and person of Christ tells him to believe that there will
be a final restoration of all creation."[^321]

Theodore writes on Romans 6:6: "All have the hope of rising with Christ,
so that the body having obtained immortality, thenceforward the
proclivity to evil should be removed. God recapitulated all things in
Christ ... as though making a compendious renewal and restoration of the
whole creation to him. Now this will take place in a future age, when
all mankind, and all powers possessed of reason, look up to him as is
right, and obtain mutual concord and firm peace."[^322]

## Author of Nestorian Declarations.

Theodore is said to have introduced universal restoration into the
liturgy of the Nestorians, of which sect he was one of the founders. His
words were translated into the Syriac and constituted the office of
devotion among that remarkable people for centuries. His works were
circulated all through Eastern Asia, through which, says Neander, the
Nestorians diffused Christianity. This great body of Christians exerted
a mighty influence until they were nearly annihilated by the merciless
Tamerlane. He is still venerated among the Nestorians as the
"Interpreter."

In Theodore\'s confession of faith he says, after stating that Adam
began the first and mortal state, "But Christ the Lord began the second
state. He in the future, revealed from heaven, will restore us all into
communion with himself. For the apostle says: 'The first man was of the
earth earthy, the second man is the Lord from heaven,' that is, who is
to appear hereafter thence, that he may restore all to the likeness of
himself."[^323]

## Dorner on Theodore.

The moderate and evangelical Dorner becomes eulogistic when referring to
this eminent Universalist: "Theodore of Mopsuestia was the crown and
climax of the school of Antioch. The compass of his learning, his
acuteness, and as we must suppose also, the force of his personal
character, conjoined with his labors through many years as a teacher
both of churches and of young and talented disciples, and as a prolific
writer, gained for him the title of Magister Orientis."[^324] He "was
regarded with an appreciation the more widely extended as he was the
first Oriental theologian of his time." Theodore held that evil was
permitted by the Creator, in order that it might become the source of
good to each and all. He says:

"God knew that men would sin in all ways, but permitted this result to
come to pass, knowing that it would ultimately be for their advantage.
For since God created man when he did not exist, and made him ruler of
so extended a system, and offered so great blessings for his enjoyment,
it was impossible that he should not have prevented the entrance of sin,
if he had not known that it would be ultimately for his advantage." He
also says that God has demonstrated that "the same result (that is seen
in the example of Christ) shall be effected in all his creatures." ...
God has determined "that there should be first a dispensation including
evils, and that then they should be removed and universal good take
their place." He taught that Christ is an illustration of universal
humanity, which will ultimately achieve his status.

## Unity in Diversity.

It may be mentioned that though Origen and Theodore were Universalists,
they reached their conclusions by different processes. Origen exalted
the freedom of the will, and taught that it could never be trammeled, so
that reformation could never be excluded from any soul. He held to
man\'s pre-existence, and that his native sinfulness resulted from
misconduct in a previous state of being. He was also extremely mystical
and allegorized and spiritualized the Scripture. Its literal meaning was
in his eyes of secondary account. Theodore, on the other hand, developed
the grammatical and historical meaning of the Word, and discarded
Origen\'s mysticism and allegorizing, and his doctrine of man\'s
pre-existence, and instead of regarding man as absolutely free,
considered him as part of a divine plan to be ultimately guided by God
into holiness. Both were Universalists, but they pursued different
routes to the same divine goal.

It is interesting to note the emphasis the early Universalists placed
upon different points. The Gnostics argued universal salvation from the
disciplinary process of transmigration; the *Sibylline Oracles* from the
prayers of the good who could not tolerate the sufferings of the damned;
Clemens Alexandrinus proved it from the remedial influence of all God\'s
punishments; Origen urged the foregoing, but added the freedom of the
will, which would ultimately embrace the good; Diodorus put it on the
ground that God\'s mercy exceeds all the desert of sin; Theodore of
Mopsuestia, that sin is an incidental part of human education, etc.

After the condemnation of Origen, Theodore and Gregory, most of their
works were destroyed by their bigoted enemies. The loss to the world by
the destruction of their writings is irreparable. Some of Theodore\'s
works are thought to exist in Syriac, in the Nestorian literature. The
future may recover some of them, as the recent past has rescued the
Sinaitic codex, the *Book of Enoch*, and other ancient manuscripts.

The liturgies of the Nestorians, largely composed by Theodore, breathe
the spirit of the universal Gospel. In the sacramental liturgy he
introduces Colossians 1:19, 20, to sustain the idea of universal
restoration: "For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness
dwell; and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things
in earth, or things in heaven."[^325]

## The Nestorians. 

The creed of the Nestorians never did, and does not in modern times,
contain any recognition of endless punishment. Mosheim says: "It is to
the honor of this sect that, of all the Christian residents of the East,
they have preserved themselves free from the numberless superstitions
which have found their way into the Greek and Latin churches."

In 431 AD, Nestorius and his followers were excommunicated from the
orthodox church for holding that Christ existed in two persons instead
of two natures. They denied the accusation, but their enemies prevailed.
Nestorius refused to call Mary "The Mother of God," but was willing to
compromise between those who held her to be such, and those who regarded
her as "Mother of man," by calling her "Mother of Christ."[^326] The
wonderful preservation and Christian zeal of the Nestorians under the
yoke of Islam is one of the marvels of history.

## The Nestorian Liturgies.

The worse than heathen Athanasian creed is not contained in any
Nestorian ritual. Nor is the so-called Apostles\' creed. But the Nicene
is recognized. Among those immortalized in the "Gezza" are Gregory,
Basil, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Diodore, all Universalists. In the
liturgy, said to be by Nestorius himself, but in which Theodore probably
had a hand, occurs this language: "All the dead have slept in the hope
of You, that by your glorious resurrection You would raise them up in
glory."[^327]

Subsequent hands have corrupted the faith of Nestorius and Theodore. For
example, the *Jewel*, written by Mar Abd Yeshua, 1298 AD, says that the
wicked "shall remain on the earth" after the resurrection of the
righteous, and "shall be consumed with the fire of remorse...this is the
true Hell whose fire is not quenched and whose worm dies not." But the
earlier faith did not contain these ideas. The litany in the Khudra, for
Easter eve, has these words: "O You Living One who descended to the
abode of the dead and preached a good hope to the souls which were
detained in Sheol, we pray You, O Lord, to have mercy upon us." "Blessed
is the king who has descended into Sheol and has raised us up, and who,
by his resurrection, has given the promise of regeneration to the human
race."

## Dr. Beecher on Theodore.

After giving numerous testimonials to the educational, missionary and
Christian zeal of the Nestorians and other followers of Theodore,
Beecher says that these advocates of ancient Restorationism were "in all
other respects Orthodox," and that their views did not prevent them
"from establishing wide-spread systems of education, from illuminating
the Arabs, and through them the dark churches who had sunk into midnight
gloom." The Universalism of Theodore was salutary in its effects on
himself and his followers. It did not "cut the nerve of missionary
enterprise."

## Instructive Facts. 

It is then apparent in the writings of the fathers, during the first
centuries of the Christian Era, that whatever views they entertained of
human destiny, --- whether they inculcate endless punishment, the
annihilation of the wicked, or universal salvation, they use the word
*aionios* to describe the duration of punishment, showing that for half
a millennium of years the word did not possess the sense of endlessness.
And it is noticeable that there is no controversy on the apparent
difference of opinion among them on the subject of man\'s destiny. And
it is probable that many of the writers who say nothing explicit, held
to the doctrine of universal restoration, as it is seen that as soon as
an author unmistakably accepts endless punishment he warmly advocates
it.

### Character of Early Universalists.

And can the fact be otherwise than significant, that, while Tertullian
and other prominent defenders of the doctrine of endless punishment were
reared as heathen, and even confess to have lived corrupt and vicious
lives in their youth, Origen, the Gregories, Basil the Great, Didymus,
Theodore, Theodorus and others were not only the greatest among the
saints in their maturity, but were reared from birth by Christian
parents, and grew up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"

Dr. Beecher pays this remarkable testimony: "*I do not know an unworthy,
low, or mean character in any prominent, open, and avowed Restorationist
of that age of freedom of inquiry which was inaugurated by the
AIexandrine school, and defended by Origen*. But besides this it is
true...that these ancient believers in final restoration lived and
toiled and suffered, in an atmosphere of joy and hope, and were not
loaded with a painful and crushing burden of sorrow in view of the
endless misery of innumerable multitudes.... It may not be true that
these results were owing mainly to the doctrine of universal
restoration. It may be that their views of Christ and the Gospel, which
were decidedly Orthodox, exerted the main power to produce these
results. But one thing is true: the doctrine of universal restoration
did not hinder them. If not, then the inquiry will arise, Why should it
now?" "In that famous age of the church\'s story, the period embracing
the Fourth and the earlier years of the Fifth Century, Universalism
seems to have been the creed of the majority of Christians in East and
West alike; perhaps even of a large majority...and in the roll of its
teachers... were... most of the greatest names of the greatest age of
primitive Christianity.... And this teaching, be it noted, is strongest
where the language of the New Testament was a living tongue; i.e., in
the great Greek fathers; it is strongest in the church\'s greatest era,
and declines as knowledge and purity decline. On the other hand, endless
penalty is most strongly taught precisely in those quarters where the
New Testament was less read in the original, and also in the most
corrupt ages of the church."[^328]

## Note. 

Olshausen declares that the opposition to the doctrine of endless
punishment and the advocacy of universal restoration has always been
found in the church, and that it has "a deep root in noble minds." His
language is (Com. I., on Matthew 12:32):[^329]

# 17. A Notable Family.

The family group of which Basil the Great, Macrina the Blessed, the
distinguished bishop of Nyssa, Gregory, and the less-known Peter of
Sebaste were members, deserves a volume rather than the few pages at our
command. Three of the four were bishops at one time. Macrina, her father
and mother, her grandmother Macrina, and three of her brothers were all
canonized as saints in the ancient church. We are not surprised that
Butler, in his *Lives of the Fathers*, should say; "We admire to see a
whole family of saints. This prodigy of grace, under God, was owing to
the example, prayers and exhortation of the elder St. Macrina, which had
this wonderful influence and effect."[^330]

## \"Macrina the Blessed.\" 

Macrina was born in 327 AD. By her intellectual ability, force of
character, and earnest piety she became the real head of the family, and
largely shaped the lives of her distinguished brothers. She early added
the name Thecla to her baptismal name, after the proto-martyr among
Christian women. She was educated with great care by her mother, under
whose direction she committed to memory large portions of the Bible,
including the whole of the Psalms.

Her rare personal beauty, great accomplishments and large fortune
attracted many suitors; Gregory says she surpassed in loveliness all of
her age and country. She was betrothed to a young advocate, who was
inspired and stimulated by her ambition and zeal, but was cut off by an
early death. She thenceforth regarded herself as a wife in the eyes of
God, and confident of a reunion hereafter, refused to listen to offers
of marriage, saying that her betrothed was living in a distant realm,
and that the resurrection would reunite them.[^331]

### A Saintly Woman.

AD 349, when she was twenty-two, her father died, and thenceforth she
devoted herself to the care of her widowed mother and the family of nine
children, and large estates which were scattered through three
provinces. Her rare executive ability and personal devotedness to her
mother and brothers and sisters were phenomenal, descending to the
minutest domestic offices.

After the death of her father, and on the death of her brother
Naucratius, AD 357, she never left her home, a beautiful place in
Annesi, near Neo-Caesarea.

AD 355, on the return of her brother Basil from Athens, full of conceit
and the ambition inspired by his secular learning, Macrina filled his
mind and heart with the love for a life of Christian service that
animated herself, and he located himself near his sister. In 355 she
established a religious sisterhood with her mother, and consecrated her
life to retirement and religious meditation, holy thoughts and exercises
--- as she said, "to the attainment of the angelical life." The
community consisted of herself, her mother, her female servants and
slaves, and soon devout women of rank joined them, and the community
became very prosperous.

Peter was made presbyter AD 371. Her mother died in 373 and her
distinguished brother in 379. Her own health had failed, when, some
months after Basil\'s death, her brother Gregory visited her.[^332] He
found her in an incurable fever, stretched on planks on the ground, and,
according to the ascetic ideas then beginning to prevail, the planks
barely covered with sackcloth. Gregory relates what followed with great
minuteness. He was overwhelmed with grief at Basil\'s death. Macrina
comforted him, and even rebuked him for mourning like a heathen when he
possessed the Christian\'s hope. He described the persecutions he had
experienced, whereupon she chided and reminded him that he ought rather
to thank his parents who had qualified him to be worthy of such
experiences. Gregory relates that she controlled all evidences of
suffering, and that her countenance continually wore a seraphic smile.

### Macrina's Religious Sentiments.

He probably gives us her exact sentiments in his own language on
universal restoration, in which she rises into a grand description of
the purifying effects of all future punishment, and the separation
thereby of the evil from the good in man, and the entire destruction of
all evil. Her words tell us their mutual views. On the \"all in
all\'\'[^333] of Paul she says:

\"The Word seems to me to lay down the doctrine of the perfect
obliteration of wickedness, for if God shall be in all things that are,
obviously wickedness shall not be in them.\" \"For it is necessary that
at some time evil should be removed utterly and entirely from the realm
of being....For since by its very nature evil cannot exist apart from
free choice, when all free choice becomes in the power of God, shall not
evil advance to utter annihilation so that no receptacle for it at all
shall be left?\"

In this conversation in which the sister sustains by far the leading
part, the resurrection (*anastasis*) and the restoration
(*apokatastasis*) are regarded as synonymous, as when Macrina declares
that \"the resurrection is only the restoration of human nature to its
pristine condition.\"[^334]

On Phil. 2:10, Macrina declares. \"When the evil has been extirpated in
the long cycles of the aeons nothing shall be left outside the
boundaries of good, but even from them shall be unanimously uttered the
confession of the Lordship of Christ.\"[^335]

She said: "The process of healing shall be proportioned to the measure
of evil in each of us, and when the evil is purged and blotted out,
there shall come in each place to each immortality and life and honor."

### Her Last Days.

Seeing the weariness of her brother she bade him rest. Revisiting her at
the close of the day she reviewed thankfully her past life and rejoiced
that she had never in her life refused any one who had asked a charity
of her, and had never been compelled to ask a charity for herself.

Next morning, Gregory says, she consoled and cheered him as long as she
could talk, and when her voice failed she conversed with her hands and
silent lips. Repeating the sign of the cross to the last moment she
finished her life and her prayers together. Her last words were in
advocacy of the doctrine of universal salvation, of which Gregory\'s
writings are full.[^336]

She was buried by her brother in the grave of her parents, in the Chapel
of the \"Forty Martyrs.\"

### Macrina a Representative Universalist.

We have here a most suggestive picture to contemplate. Macrina at the
head of a sisterhood, consisting of several hundred women of all grades,
from her own rank down to slaves. Their sole object was the cultivation
of the religious life. Can it be otherwise than that the views of human
destiny she held were dwelt upon by her in the religious exercises of
the institution, and must they not have been generally sympathized with
by the devout inmates? And can we doubt that those who had here retired
from the world to cultivate their religious natures, were representative
in their views of human destiny of the Christian community generally?
The fact that Macrina, and her brothers, high functionaries in the
church, express Universalism, not polemically or disputatiously, but as
a matter uncontested, should persuade us that it was the unchallenged
sentiment of the time.

Curiously enough. Cave, in his \"Lives of the Fathers,\" questions
Macrina\'s Universalism. In his life of Gregory he says, after sketching
Macrina\'s life: \"She is said by some to have been infected with
Origen\'s opinions, but finding it reported by no other than Nicephorus,
I suppose he mistook her for her grandmother, Macrina, auditor of St.
Gregory, who had Origen for his tutor.\" This is a specimen instance of
the manner in which historians have read history through theological
spectacles, and written history in ink squeezed from their creeds.

There is no doubt that the elder Macrina was of the same faith as her
granddaughter, for she was a disciple of Gregory Thaumaturgus, who
idolized Origen. On the testimony of Gregory of Nyssa, \"the blessed
Macrina\" lived a holy life and died the death of a perfect Christian,
molded, guided and sustained by the influence and power of Universalism.
And the careful reader of the history of those early days can but feel
that she represents the prevailing religious faith of the three first
and three best centuries of the church.

## Basil the Great. 

Basil the Great was born in Caesarea, AD 329. His family were wealthy
Christians. The preceding sketch shows that his grandmother Macrina, and
his mother, Emmelia, were canonized. His brothers, Gregory of Nyssa, and
Peter of Sebaste, and his sister Macrina are all saints in both the
Greek and the Roman churches. His was a most lovable and loving spirit.
His works abound in descriptions of the beauties of nature, which is
something rare in ancient literature, outside of the Bible. He resided
for many years in a romantic locality, with his mother and sister. AD
364, against his will, he was made presbyter, and in 370 was elected
bishop of Caesarea. He died AD 379. He devoted himself to the sick, and
founded the splendid hospital Basilias, for lepers, of whom he took
care, not even neglecting to kiss them in defiance of contagion. He
stands in the highest group of pulpit orators, theologians, pastors, and
rulers, and most eminent writers and noble men of the church\'s first
five hundred years.

### Basil's Language.

Basil says: \"The Lord\'s peace is co-extensive with all time. For all
things shall be subject to him, and all things shall acknowledge his
empire; and when God shall be all in all, those who now excite discord
by revolts having been quite pacified, shall praise God in peaceful
concord.\" ... On the words in Isaiah, 1:24: \"My anger will not cease,
I will burn them,\" he says,.. And why is this? In order that I may
purify.\"

Basil was \"the strenuous champion of orthodoxy in the East, the
restorer of union to the divided Oriental church, and the promoter of
unity between the East and the West.\" Theodoret styles him \"one of the
lights of the world.\"[^337]

Among other quotable passages is this: \"For we have often observed that
it is the sins which are consumed, not the very persons to whom the sins
have befallen.\" But there are passages to be found in Basil susceptible
of sustaining the doctrine of interminable punishment. This great
theologian was infected with the wretched idea prevalent in his day,
that the wise could accept truths not to be taught to the multitude. But
the brother of, and co-laborer with, Gregory of Nyssa, and the \"Blessed
Macrina,\" he could but have sympathized with their sublime faith.

### Cave's Error.

Cave scarcely alludes to Basil\'s views of destmy, but faintly intimates
the truth when he says: "For though his enemies, to serve their own ends
by blasting his reputation, did sometimes charge him with corrupting the
Christian doctrine, and entertaining impious and unorthodox sentiments,
and that too in some of the greater articles, yet the objection, when
looked into, did quickly vanish, himself solemnly professing upon this
occasion, that however in other respects he had enough to answer for,
yet this was his glory and triumph, that he had never entertained false
notions of God, but had constantly kept the faith pure and inviolate, as
he had received it from his ancestors."

Remembering his sainted grandmother, Macrina, and his spiritual fathers,
Origen and Clemens Alexandrinus, we can understand his disclaimer.[^338]

Notwithstanding Basil\'s probable belief in the final restoration, he
employs as severe language in reference to the sinner\'s sufferings as
do any of the fathers who have left no record on the subject of man\'s
final destiny. He says: \"With what body shall it endure those
interminable and unendurable scourges, where is the quenchless fire and
the worm punishing deathlessly, and the dark and horrible abyss of hell,
and the bitter groans, and the vehement wailing, and the weeping and
gnashing of teeth, where the evils have no end.\"[^339]

### Eulogies of Basil.

He is said to have had learning the most ample, eloquence of the highest
order, forensic powers unsurpassed, literary ability unequaled, \"a
style of writing admirable, almost inimitable, proper, perspicuous,
significant, soft, smooth and easy, and yet persuasive and powerful;\"
as a philosopher as wise as he was accomplished as a theologian. Erasmus
gives him the pre-eminence above Pericles, Isocrates and Demosthenes,
and ranks him higher than Athanasius, Nazianzen, Nyssen and Chrysostom.
And Cave exhausts eulogy and panegyric in describing his \"moral and
divine accomplishments,\" and closes his account by saying: "Perhaps it
is an instance hardly to be paralleled in any age, for three brothers,
all men of note and eminency, to be bishops at the same time."[^340] He
might have added --- and with a sister their full equal.

Basil\'s grand spirit can be seen in his reply to the emperor, when the
latter threatened him, should he not obey the sovereign\'s command. His
noble answer compelled the emperor to forego his purpose. Basil said he
did not fear the emperor\'s threats; confiscation could not harm one who
only possessed a suit of plain clothes and a few books; he could not be
banished for he could find a home anywhere, as the earth was God\'s, and
himself everywhere a stranger; his frail body could endure but little
torture, and death would be a favor, as it would only conduct him to
God, his eternal home.

### The Mass of Christians Universalists.

Basil says in one place, in a work attributed to him, \"The mass of men
(Christians) say that there is to be an end of punishment to those who
are punished.\"[^341] If the work is not Basil\'s, the testimony as to
the state of opinion at that time is no less valuable: \"The mass of men
say that there is to be an end of punishment.\"

## Gregory Nyssen. 

He was born about 335 AD and died 390. He was made bishop 372. From the
time he was thirty-five until his death, he, Didymus and Diodorus of
Tarsus, were the unopposed advocates of universal redemption. Most
unique and valuable of all his works was the biography of his sister,
described in our sketch of Macrina. His descriptions of her life,
conversations and death are gems of patristic literature. They overflow
with declarations of universal salvation.

Gregory was devoted to the memory of Origen as his spiritual godfather,
and teacher, as were his saintly brother and sister. He has well been
called \"the flower of orthodoxy.\" He declared that Christ \"frees
mankind from their wickedness, healing the very inventor of
wickedness.\" He asks: \"What is then the scope of St. Paul\'s argument
in this place? That the nature of evil shall one day be wholly
exterminated, and divine, immortal goodness embrace within itself all
intelligent natures; so that of all who were made by God, not one shall
be exiled from his kingdom; when all the alloy of evil that like a
corrupt matter is mingled in things, shall be dissolved, and consumed in
the furnace of purifying fire, and everything that had its origin from
God shall be re- stored to its pristine state of purity.\" \"This is the
end of our hope, that nothing shall be left contrary to the good, but
that the divine life, penetrating all things, shall absolutely destroy
death from existing things, sin having been previously destroyed,\"
etc.[^342] \"For it is evident that God will in truth be 'in all' when
there shall be no evil in existence, when every created being is at
harmony with itself, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord; when every creature shall have been made one body. Now the body of
Christ, as I have often said, is the whole of humanity.\"[^343] On the
Psalms, "Neither is sin from eternity, nor will it last to eternity. For
that which did not always exist shall not last forever."

His language demonstrates the fact that the word *aionios* did not have
the meaning of endless duration in his day. He distinctly says:
\"Whoever considers the divine power will plainly perceive that it is
able at length to restore by means of the *aionion* purgation and
expiatory sufferings, those who have gone even to this extremity of
wickedness.\" Thus \"everlasting\" punishment will end in salvation,
according to one of the greatest of the fathers of the Fourth Century.

### Gregory's Language.

In his *Sermo Catecheticus Magnus*, a work of forty chapters, for the
teaching of theological learners, written to show the harmony of
Christianity with the instincts of the human heart, he asserts \"the
annihilation of evil, the restitution of all things, and the final
restoration of evil men and evil spirits to the blessedness of union
with God, so that he may be 'all in all,' embracing all things endued
with sense and reason\" --- doctrines derived by him from Origen. To
save the credit of a doctor of the church of acknowledged orthodoxy, it
has been asserted from the time of Germanus of Constantinople, that
these passages were foisted in by heretical writers. But there is no
foundation for this hypothesis, and we may safely say that \"the wish is
father to the thought,\" and that the final restitution of all things
was distinctly held and taught by him in his writings.

He teaches that \"when death approaches to life, and darkness to light,
and the corruptible to the incorruptible, the inferior is done away with
and reduced to non-existence, and the thing purged is benefited, just as
the dross is purged from gold by fire....In the same way in the long
circuits of time, when the evil of nature which is now mingled and
implanted in them has been taken away, whensoever the restoration[^344]
to their old condition of the things that now lie in wickedness takes
place, there will be a unanimous thanksgiving from the whole creation,
both of those who have been punished[^345] in the purification[^346] and
of those who have not at all needed purification.[^347]

\"I believe that punishment will be administered in proportion to each
one\'s corruptness.... Therefore to whom there is much corruption
attached, with him it is necessary that the purgatorial time which is to
consume it should be great, and of long duration; but to him in whom the
wicked disposition has been already in part subjected, a proportionate
degree of that sharper and more vehement punishment shall be remitted.
All evil, however, must at length be entirely removed from everything,
so that it shall no more exist. For such being the nature of sin that it
cannot exist without a corrupt motive, it must of course be perfectly
dissolved, and wholly destroyed, so that nothing can remain a receptacle
of it, when all motive and influence shall spring from God alone,\" etc.

### Perversions of Historians.

The manner in which historians and biographers have been guilty of
*suppressio veri* by their prejudices or obtuseness to fact, is
illustrated by Cave in his \"Lives of the Fathers,\" when, speaking of
this most out-spoken Universalist, he says, that on the occasion of the
death of his sister Macrina, \"he penned his excellent book (\'Life and
Resurrection\'), wherein if some later hand have interspersed some few
Origenian dogmata, it is no more than what they have done to some few
other of his tracts, to give his thoughts vent upon those noble
arguments.\" The \"later\" hands were impelled by altogether different
\"dogmata,\" and suppressed or modified Origen\'s doctrines, as Rufinus
confesses, instead of inserting them in the works of their predecessors.
If Gregory has suffered at all at the hands of mutilators, it has been
by those who have minimized and not those who have magnified his
Universalism. But this aspersion originated with Germanus, bishop of
Constantinople (AD 730), in harmony with a favorite mode of opposition
to Universalism. In Germanus\'s Antapodotikos he endeavored to show that
all the passages in Gregory which treat of the apokatastasis were
interpolated by heretics.[^348] This charge has often been echoed since.
But the prejudiced Daille calls it \"the last resort of those who with a
stupid and absurd pertinacity will have it that the ancients wrote
nothing different from the faith at present received; for the whole of
Gregory Nyssen\'s orations are so deeply imbued with the pestiferous
doctrine in question, than it can have been inserted by none other than
the author himself.\"[^349] The conduct of historians, not only of those
who were theologically warped, but of such as sought to be impartial on
the opinions of the early Christians on man\'s final destiny, is
something phenomenal. Even Lecky writes: \"Origen, and his disciple
Gregory of Nyssa, in a somewhat hesitating manner, diverged from the
prevailing opinion (eternal torments) and strongly inclined...to the
belief in the ultimate salvation of all. But they were alone in their
opinion. With these two exceptions, all the fathers proclaimed the
eternity of torments.\"[^350] It is shown in this volume that not only
were Diodore, Theodore, and others of the Antiochan school Universalists
but that for centuries four theological schools taught the doctrine. A
most singular fact in this connection is that Prof. Shedd, elsewhere in
this book, denies his own statement similar to Lecky\'s, as shown on a
previous page. This is the testimony of Dr. Schaff in his valuable
history:

\"Gregory adopts the doctrine of the final restoration of all things.
The plan of redemption is in his view absolutely universal, and embraces
all spiritual beings. Good is the only positive reality; evil is the
negative, the non-existent, and must finally abolish itself, because it
is not of God. Unbelievers must indeed pass through a second death, in
order to be purged from the filthiness of the flesh. But God does not
give them up, for they are his property, spiritual natures allied to
him. His love, which draws pure souls easily and without pain to itself,
becomes a purifying fire to all who cleave to the earthly, till the
impure element is driven off. As all comes forth from God, so must all
return into him at last.\" \"Universal salvation (including Satan) was
clearly taught by Gregory of Nyssa, a profound thinker of the school of
Origen.\"

In his comments on the Psalms, Gregory says: \"By which God shows that
neither is sin from eternity nor will it last to eternity. Wickedness
being thus destroyed, and its imprint being left in none, all shall be
fashioned after Christ, and in all that one character shall shine, which
originally was imprinted on our nature.\" \"Sin,\...whose end is
extinction, and a change to nothingness...from evil to a state of
blessedness.\" On Ps. 57:1: \"Sin...is like a plant on a house top, not
rooted, not sown, not ploughed in...in the restoration to goodness of
all things, it passes away and vanishes. So not even a trace of the evil
which now abounds in us, shall remain, etc.\" If sin be not cured here
its cure will be effected hereafter. And God\'s threats are that
\"through fear we may be trained to avoid evil; but by those who are
more intelligent it (the judgment) is believed to be a medicine,\" etc.
\"God himself is not really seen in wrath.\" \"The soul which is united
to sin must be set in the fire, so that that which is unnatural and
vile...may be removed, consumed by the *aionion* fire.\"[^351] \"Thus
the (*aionion*) fire was regarded by Gregory as purifying. \"If it (the
soul) remains (in the present life) the healing is accomplished in the
life beyond.\" (Greek)[^352]

Farrar tells us: \"There is no scholar of any weight in any school of
theology who does not now admit that two at least of the three great
Cappadocians believed in the final and universal restoration of human
souls.... And the remarkable fact is that Gregory developed these views
without in any way imperiling his reputation for orthodoxy, and without
the faintest reminder that he was deviating from the strictest paths of
Catholic opinion.\" Professor Plumptre truthfully says: \"His
Universalism is as wide and unlimited as that of Bishop Newton of
Bristol.\"

### Opinions in the Fourth Century.

The Council of Constantinople, AD 381, which perfected the Nicene Creed,
was participated in by the two Gregorys; Gregory Nazianzen presided and
Gregory Nyssen added the clauses to the Nicene creed that are in in
italics on a previous page in this volume. They were both Universalists.
Would any council, in ancient or modern times, composed of believers in
endless punishment, select an avowed Universalist to preside over its
deliberations, and guide its \"doctrinal transactions?\" And can anyone
consistently think that Gregory\'s Universalism was unacceptable to the
great council over which he presided? \"Some of the strongest statements
of Gregory\'s views will be found in his enthusiastic reports of
Macrina\'s conversations, related in the preceding chapter, with which,
every reader will see, he was in the fullest sympathy. Besides the works
of Gregory named above, passages expressive of universal salvation may
be found in \"Oratio de Mortuis,\" \"De Perfectione Christiani,\" etc.

\"By the days of Gregory of Nyssa it (Universalism), aided by the
unrivaled learning, genius and piety of Origen, had prevailed, and had
succeeded in leavening, not the East alone, but much of the West. While
the doctrine of annihilation has practically disappeared, Universalism
has established itself, has become the prevailing opinion, even in
quarters antagonistic to the school of Alexandria.... The church of
North Africa, in the person of Augustine, enters the field. The Greek
tongue soon becomes unknown in the West, and the Greek fathers
forgotten.... On the throne of Him whose name is Love is now seated a
stern Judge (a sort of Roman governor). The Father is lost in the
Magistrate.\"[^353]

Dean Stanley candidly ascribes to Gregory \"the blessed hope that God\'s
justice and mercy are not controlled by the power of evil, that sin is
not everlasting, and that in the world to come punishment will be
corrective and not final, and will be ordered by a love and justice, the
height and depths of which we cannot here fathom or comprehend.\"[^354]

# 18. Additional Authorities. 

Going back a little we find several authors whose works in part have
escaped the ravages of time and the destructive hostility of opponents.
We have found ourselves a hundred times wishing, while pursuing these
enquiries, that the literature of the first five centuries could have
been printed and scattered to the world\'s ends, instead of having been
limited, as it was, of course, before the invention of printing, to a
few manuscripts so easily destroyed by the bigoted opponents of our
faith into whose hands they fell. We should have many fold more
testimonies than have survived to tell the story of primitive belief.

## Marcellus of Ancyra.

Marcellus of Ancyra, AD 315, quoted by Eusebius, says: "For what else do
the words mean, \'until the times of the restitution\' (Acts 3:21), but
that the apostle designed to point out that time in which all things
partake of that perfect restoration.\"

## Titus of Bostra.

Titus of Bostra, AD 338-378. The editor of his works says that Titus was
\"the most learned among the bishops of his age, and a most famous
champion of the truth.\" Tillemont unwillingly ad-mits that \"he seems
to have followed the dangerous error ascribed to Origen, that the pains
of the damned, and even those of the demons themselves, will not be
eternal.\"[^355] Certainly Titus\'s own language justifies this
excellent suspicion.

He says: \"Thus the mystery was completed by the Savior in order that,
perfection being completed through all things, and in all things, by
Christ, all universally shall be made one through Christ and in
Christ.\" He says again: "The very abyss of torment is indeed the place
of chastisement, but it is not eternal (*aionion*) nor did it exist in
the original constitution of nature. It was afterwards, as a remedy for
sinners, that it might cure them. And the punishments are holy, as they
are remedial and salutary in their effect on transgressors; for they are
inflicted, not to preserve them in their wickedness, but to make them
cease from their wickedness. The anguish of their suffering compels them
to break off their vices.... If death were an evil, blame would
rightfully fall on him who appointed it."[^356]

## Ambrose of Milan. 

Ambrose of Milan, AD 340-398, says: "What then hinders our believing
that he who is beaten small as the dust is not annihilated, but is
changed for the better; so that, instead of an earthly man, he is made a
spiritual man, and our believing that he who is destroyed, is so
destroyed that all taint is removed, and there remains but what is pure
and clean. And in God\'s saying of the adversaries of Jerusalem, \'They
shall be as though they were not,\' you are to understand they shall
exist substantially, and as converted, but shall not exist as
enemies.... God gave death, not as a penalty, but as a remedy; death was
given for a remedy as the end of evils.\" ... "How shall the sinner
exist in the future, seeing the place of sin cannot be of long
continuance?"[^357] ... Because God\'s image is that of the one God, it
like Him starts from one, and is diffused to infinity. And, once again,
from an infinite number all things return into one as into their end,
because God is both beginning and end of all things.[^358] ... How then,
shall (all things) be subject to Christ? In this very way in which the
Lord Himself said. \'Take my yoke upon you,\' for it is not the untamed
who bear the yoke, but the humble and gentle,... so that in Jesus\'s
name every knee shall bend.... Is this subjection of Christ now
completed? Not at all. Because the subjection of Christ consists not in
few, but in all....Christ will be subject to God in us by means of the
obedience of all;...when vices having been cast away, and sin reduced to
submission, one spirit of all people, in one sentiment, shall with one
accord begin to cleave to God, then God will be all in all,...when all
then shall have believed and done the will of God, Christ will be all
and in all; and when Christ shall be all in all, God will be all in
all.[^359]...At present he is overall by his power, but it is necessary
that he be in all by their free will:[^360]...So the Son of man came to
save that which was lost, that is, all, for, 'As in Adam all died, so,
too, in Christ shall all be made alive.'\"[^361] \"For, if the guilty
die, who have been unwilling to leave the path of sin, even against
their will they still gain, not of nature but of fault, that they may
sin no more.\" ... \"Death is not bitter; but to the sinner it is
bitter, and yet life is more bitter, for it is a deadlier thing to live
in sin than to die in sin, because the sinner as long as he lives
increases in sin, but if he dies he ceases to sin.\"[^362]

Cave says that Ambrose quotes and adapts many of the writings of the
Greek Fathers, particularly Origen; and Jerome declares that Ambrose was
indebted to Didymus for the most of his *de Spiritu Sanctu*. Both these,
it will be noted, were Universalists. Augustine tells us that every day
after his morning devotions Ambrose studied the Scriptures, chiefly by
the aid of the Greek commentators, and especially of Origen and
Hippolytus, and of Didymus and Basil.[^363] Three of these at least were
Universalists. \"Perhaps his most original book is '0n the Blessing of
Death,' in which he takes a singularly mild view of the punishment of
the wicked, expresses his belief in a purifying fire, and argues that
whatever that punishment be, it is a state distinctly preferable to a
sinful life. His eschatology was deeply influenced by the larger hopes
of Origen.\"[^364]

The language of Ambrose in his comments on Ps. 118, is as follows:
\"Dives in the Gospel, although a sinner, is pressed with penal agonies,
that he may escape the sooner.\"[^365] ... Again: \"Those who do not
come to the first, but are reserved for the second resurrection, shall
be burned till they fill up the times between the first and second
resurrection, or should they not have done so, will remain longer in
punishment.\"

The Ambrosiaster is by an unknown author, anciently erroneously supposed
to be Ambrose, as it was bound with the works of this father. On I Cor.
15:28, the Ambrosiaster says: \"This is implied in the Savior\'s
subjecting himself to the Father; this is involved in God\'s being all
in all, namely, when every creature learns that Christ is his head, and
that God the Father is the head of Christ, then God the Father is all in
all. This implies that every creature thinks one and the same thing, so
that every tongue of celestials, terrestials and infernals shall confess
God as the great One from whom all things are derived.\" This sentiment
he avows in other passages.

## Serapion.

Serapion, the companion of Athanasius, AD 346, says of evil; \"It is of
itself nothing, nor can it in itself exist, or exist always; but it is
in process of vanishing, and by vanishing proved to be unable to
exist.\"[^366]

## Macarius Magnes.

Macarius Magnes, AD 370, says that death was ordained at the first, \"in
order that, by the dissolution of the body, all the sin proceeding from
the connection (of soul and body) should be totally destroyed.\"[^367]

## Marius Victorinus.

Marius Victorinus, AD 360, was born in Africa, and was a famous
rhetorician, whose writings abound with expressions of the faith of
Universalism. On I Cor. 15:28, he says: \"All things shall be rendered
spiritual at the consummation of the world. At the consummation all
things shall be one....[^368] Therefore all things converted to him
shall become one, i. e., spiritual; through the Son all things shall be
made one, for all things are by him, for all things that exist are one,
though they be different. For the body of the entire universe is not
like a mere heap, which becomes a body, only by the contact of its
particles; but it is a body chiefly in its several parts being closely
and mutually bound together --- it forms a continuous chain. For the
chain is this, God: Jesus: the Spirit: the intellect: the soul: the
angelic host: and lastly, all subordinate bodily existences.\" On Eph.
1:4: \"Thus the mystery was completed by the Savior in order that,
perfection having been completed throughout all things, and in all
things by Christ, all universally should be made one through Christ and
in Christ.... And because he (Christ) is the life, he is that by whom
all things have been made, and for whom all things have been made, for
all things cleansed by him return into eternal life.\"

## Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers.

Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers, (died, AD 368), is said by Jerome to have
translated nearly 40,000 lines of Origen. On Luke 15:4, he says: \"This
one sheep (lost) is man, and by one man the entire race is to be
understood; the ninety and nine are the heavenly angels ... and by us
(mankind) who are all one, the number of the heavenly church is to be
filled up. And therefore it is that every creature awaits the revelation
of the sons of God.\" On Psalm. 59:32, 33: \"Even the abode of hell is
to praise God.\" Also, \"\'As thou hast given him power over all flesh
in order that he should give eternal life to all that thou hast given
him,.... so the Father gave all things, and the Son accepted all
things,... and honored by the Father was to honor the Father, and to
employ the power received in giving eternity of life to all flesh....
Now this is life eternal that they may know thee.\"[^369]

## John Cassian.

John Cassian, AD 390-440. This celebrated man was educated in the
monastery in Bethlehem, and was the founder of two monasteries in
Marseilles. He wrote much, and drew the fire of Augustine, whose
doctrines he strenuously assailed. Neander declares of him, that his
views of the divine love extended to all men, \"which wills the
salvation of all, and refers everything to this; even subordinating the
punishment of the wicked to this simple end.\"[^370] Ueberweg says
Cassian \"could not admit that God would save only a portion of the
human race, and that Christ died only for the elect.\" Hagenbach states
that the erroneous idea that God \"would save only a few\" is in the
opinion of Cassian *ingene sacrilegium*, a great sacrilege or blasphemy.
Neander, in his \"History of Dogmas,\" remarks: "The practically
Christian guided him in treating the doctrines of faith; he admitted
nothing which was not suited to satisfy thoroughly the religious wants
of men....The idea of divine justice in the determination of man\'s lot
after the first transgression did not preponderate in Cassian\'s
writings as in Augustine\'s, but the idea of a disciplinary divine love,
by the leadings of which men are to be led to repentance. He appeals
also to the mysteriousness of God\'s ways, not as concerns
predestination, but the variety of the leadings by which God leads
different individuals to salvation. In no instance, however, can divine
grace operate independently of the free self-determination of man; as
the husbandman must do his part, but all this avails nothing without the
divine blessing, so man must do his part, yet this profits nothing
without divine grace." To which T. B. Thayer, D. D., adds in the
\'\'Universalist Quarterly\": \"It is a fact worth noting in this
connection, that Cassianus went to Constantinople in AD 403, where he
listened to the celebrated Chrysostom, by whom he was ordained as
Deacon. Speaking of Chrysostom, Neander says that but for the necessity
of opposing those who made too light of sin and its retributions and
would fain reason away the doctrine of eternal punishment, 'his mild and
amiable spirit might not otherwise be altogether disinclined to the
doctrine of a universal restoration, with which he must have become
acquainted at an earlier period, from being a disciple of Diodorus of
Tarsus.'...This justifies the remark of Neander that we may perhaps
\'discern in these traits of Cassianus the spirit of the great
Chrysostom, with whom he long lived in the capacity of deacon, and whose
disciple he delighted to call himself.\'\"

## Theodoret, the Blessed.

Theodoret, the Blessed, was born AD 387, and died 458. He was ordained
Bishop of Cyrus in Syria, 420. He was a pupil of Theodore of Mopsuestia,
and was also a student of eloquence and sacred literature of Chrysostom.
Dr. Schaff calls his continuation of Eusebius\'s Ecclesiastical History
most valuable. Neander, Murdoch, and Mosheim rank him high in learning,
eloquence and goodness. He illustrates one of the many contradictions of
the assertions of merely sectarian scholars. Though Dr. Shedd says that
\"the only exception to the belief in the eternity of future punishment
in the ancient church appears in the Alexandrian school,\" yet,
Theodoret, Theodore, Diodore and others were all of the Antiochan
school. Dr. Orello Cone first called the attention of our church to this
father, who is not even mentioned by Dr. Ballou, in his \"Ancient
History of Universalism,\" and we quote from his article, copied in part
from \"The New York Christian Ambassador\" into \"The Universalist
Quarterly,\" April, 1866. Dr. Cone says that Theodoret regarded the
resurrection as the elevation and quickening of man\'s entire nature.\"
He gives this higher spiritual view of the resurrection (anastasis) in
his commentary on Eph. 1:10, \'For through the dispensation or
incarnation of Christ the nature of men arises,\' *anista,* or is
resurrected, 'and puts on incorruption.' He does not say the bodies of
men, but the nature (*phusis*) is resurrected.\"

Theodoret says, on \"Gathering all things in Christ:\" \"And the visible
creation shall be liberated from corruption, and shall attain
incorruption, and the inhabitants of the invisible worlds shall live in
perpetual joy, for grief and sadness and groaning shall be done away.\"
... On the universal atonement: --- \"Teaching that he would free from
the power of death not only his own body, but at the same time the
entire nature of the human race, he presently adds: \'And I, if I be
lifted from the earth will draw all men unto me;\' for I will not suffer
what I have undertaken to raise the body only, but I will fully
accomplish the resurrection to all men.... He has paid the debt for us,
and blotted out the handwriting that was against us, ... and having done
these things, he quickened together with himself the entire nature of
men.\"

He formed his Christian system on Theodore\'s, and on that of Diodore of
Tarsus, both Universalists. Allin says, he "was perhaps the most famous,
and certainly the most learned teacher of his age; uniting to a noble
intellect a character and accomplishments equally noble." He published a
defense of Diodore and Theodore, unfortunately lost. On I Cor. 15:28,
Theodoret says: \"But in the future life corruption ceasing and
immortality being conferred, the passions have no place, and these being
removed, no kind of sin is committed. So from that time God is all in
all, when all, freed from sin, and turned to him, shall have no
inclination to evil.\" On Eph. 1:23, he says: \"In the present life God
is in all, for his nature is without limits, but is not all in all. But
in the coming life, when mortality is at an end and immortality granted,
and sin has no longer any place, God will be all in all.[^371] For the
Lord, who loves man, punishes medicinally, that he may check the course
of impiety.\"

### Works of Theodoret.

Gregory the Great says that the Roman church refused to acknowledge
Theodoret\'s History because he praised Theodore of Mopsuestia, and
insisted that he was a great doctor in the church. Theodoret says that
Theodore was \'\'the teacher of all the churches, and the opponent of
all the sects of heresy,\" so that in his opinion Universalism was not
heretical.

## Evagrius Ponticus.

Evagrius Ponticus, AD 390. The works of this eminent saint and scholar
were destroyed by the Fifth General Council that condemned him ---
though not as a Universalist --- a hundred and fifty years after his
death. The council anathematized him with Didymus. It is most apparent
that the great multitude of Christians must have accepted views which
were so generally advocated and unchallenged during those early years,
by the best and greatest of the fathers. Evagrius is said by Jerome in
his epistle to Ctesiphon against the Pelagians, to have been an
Origenist. He wrote three books, the \"Saint\" or \"Gnostic,\" the
\"Monk,\" and the \"Refutation.\"

## Cyril of Alexandria.

Cyril of Alexandria (AD 412) says: "Traversing the lowest recesses of
the infernal regions, after that he (Christ) had preached to the spirits
there, he led forth the captives in his strength."[^372] "Now when sin
has been destroyed, how should it be but that death too, should wholly
perish?\" ... "Through Christ has been saved the holy multitude of the
fathers, nay, the whole human race altogether, which was earlier in time
(than Christ\'s death) for he died for all, and the death of all was
done away in him."[^373]

## Rufinus.

Rufinus, AD 345-410, wrote an elaborate defense of Origen, and in the
preface to *De Principiis* he declares that he excised from that work of
Origen all that was "discordant with our (the accepted Christian)
belief." As the work still abounds in expressions of Universalism, not
only his sympathy with that belief, but also the fact that it was then
the prevailing Christian belief cannot be questioned. Huetsays that he
taught the temporary duration of punishment.[^374]

## Domitian, Bishop of Galatia.

Dr. Ballou quotes Domitian, Bishop of Galatia, as probably a
Universalist (AD 546), who is reported by Facundus to have written a
book in which he declares that those who condemned Origen have
\"condemned all the saints who were before him, and who have been after
him.\"[^375]

## Diodore, Bishop of Tarsus.

Diodore, Bishop of Tarsus, from 378 to 394 AD, was of the Antiochan or
Syrian school. He opposed Origen on some subjects but agreed with his
Universalism. He says: "For the wicked there are punishments, not
perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a
disadvantage, but they are to be punished for a brief period according
to the amount of malice in their works. They shall therefore suffer
punishment for a short space, but immortal blessedness having no end
awaits them ... the penalties to be inflicted for their many and grave
sins are very far surpassed by the magnitude of the mercy to be shown
them. The resurrection, therefore, is regarded as a blessing not only to
the good, but also to the evil."[^376]

The same authority affirms that many Nestorian bishops taught the same
doctrine. The *Dictionary of Christian Biography* observes: "Diodorus of
Tarsus taught that the penalty of sin is not perpetual, but issues in
the blessedness of immortality, and (he) was followed by Stephanus,
Bishop of Edessa, and Salomo of Bassora, and Isaac of Nineveh." "Even
those who are tortured in Gehenna are under the discipline of the divine
charity." "And they were followed in their turn by Georgius of Arbela,
and Ebed Jesu of Soba."

Diodore contended that God\'s mercy would punish the wicked less than
their sins deserved, inasmuch as his mercy gave the good more than they
deserved. He denied that Deity would bestow immortality for the purpose
of prolonging and perpetuating suffering. Diodore and Theodore, the
first, Chrysostom\'s teacher, and the second his fellow-student, were
really the pioneers in teaching Scripture by help of history, criticism
and philology.[^377] They may be regarded as the forerunners of modern
interpretation. Like so many others of the ancient writings Diodore\'s
works have perished, and we have only a few quotations from them,
contained in the works of others. But we have enough to qualify him to
occupy an honorable place among the Universalists of the Fourth Century.

Even Dr. Pusey is compelled to admit the Universalism of Diodore of
Tarsus, and Theodore of Mopsuestia. He says, quoting from Salomo of
Bassora, 1222, some eight hundred years after their death: "The two
writers use different arguments and have different theories. Theodorus
rests his on Holy Scripture, 'until you have paid the uttermost
farthing,' and 'the many and few stripes,' and attributes the amendment
of those who have done ill all their lives to the discovery of their
mistake. Diodorus says that punishment must not be perpetual, lest the
immortality prepared for them be useless to them; he twice repeats that
punishment, though varied according to their deserts, would be for a
short time. His ground was his conviction that since God\'s rewards so
far exceed the deserts of the good, the like mercy would be shown to the
evil."[^378]

## Later Additional Authorities.

Though somewhat later than the projected limits of this work, two or
three authors may be named.

### Macarius.

Macarius is said by Evagrius to have been ejected from his see in 552,
for maintaining the opinions of Origen. Whether universal restitution
was among them is uncertain.

### Peter Chrysologus.

Peter Chrysologus, 433, Bishop of Ravenna, in a sermon on the Good
Shepherd, says the lost sheep represents "the whole human race lost in
Adam," and that Christ "followed the one, seeks the one, in order that
in the one he may restore all."

### Stephan Bar-Sudaili.

Stephan Bar-Sudaili, Abbot of Edessa, in Mesopotamia, at the end of the
Fifth Century, taught Universalism, --- the termination of all
punishments in the future world, and their purifying character. The
fallen angels are to receive mercy, and all things are to be restored,
so that God may be all in all.[^379] He was at the head of a monastery.
Attacked as a heretic he left Edessa and repaired to Palestine, which in
those days seems to have been the refuge of those who desired freedom of
opinion. How many might have sympathized with him in Mesopotamia or in
Palestine cannot be known.

### Maximus, the Confessor.

Maximus, the Confessor. As late as the Seventh Century, in spite of the
power of Roman tyranny and Pagan error, the truth survived. Maximus ---
580-662 --- was secretary of the Emperor Heraclius, and confidential
friend of Pope Martin I. He opposed the Emperor Constans II, in his
attempts to control the religious convictions of his subjects, and was
banished in 653 AD, and died of ill treatment. He was both scholar and
saint. Neander says:

\"The fundamental ideas of Maximus seem to lead to the doctrine of a
final universal restoration, which in fact is intimately connected also
with the system of Gregory of Nyssa, to which he most closely adhered.
Yet he was too much fettered by the church system of doctrine distinctly
to express anything of the sort." Neander adds, that in his aphorisms
"the reunion of all rational essences with God is established as the
final end." "Him who wholly unites all things in the end of the ages, or
in eternity." **Ueberweg** states that "Maximus taught that God had
revealed himself through nature and by his Word. The incarnation of God
in Christ was the culmination of revelation, and would therefore have
taken place even if man had not fallen. The Universe will end in the
union of all things with God."

# 19. The Deterioration of Christian Thought.

## Transition of Christianity.

The great transition from the Christianity of the Apostles to the
pseudo-Christianity of the patriarchs and emperors --- the
transformation of Christianity to Churchianity --- may be said to have
begun with Constantine, at the beginning of the Fourth Century. Its
relations to the temporal power experienced an entire change. Heathenism
surrendered to it. As the stones of the heathen temples were rebuilt
into Christian churches, so the Pagan principles held by the masses
modified and corrupted the religion of Christ; while the worldliness of
secular interests derived from the union of church and state, exerted a
debasing influence, and the Christianity of the Catacombs and of Origen
became the church of the popes, of the Inquisition, and of the Middle
Ages.

"The writers of the Fourth Century generally contradict those of the
Second, who were in part witnesses, or reported credible evidence and
plausible traditions, whereas those later fathers were only critics, and
most of them very indifferent and biased ones. For they often proceed
from systems, historical and doctrinal, which strongly impair their
qualifications for being judges." There seems an entire change in the
church after the Nicene Council. "The Anti-Nicene age was the World
against the Church; the Post-Nicene age is the history of the World in
the Church. As an antagonist the World was powerless; as an ally it
became dangerous and its influence disastrous."[^380]

"From the time of Constantine," says Schaff, "church discipline
declines; the whole Roman world having become nominally Christian, and
the host of hypocritical professors multiplying beyond all control." It
was during Constantine\'s reign that, among other foreign corruptions,
monasticism came into Christianity, from the Hindu religions and other
sources, and gave rise to those ascetic organizations so foreign to the
spirit of the author of our religion, and so productive of error and
evil. Perhaps the deterioration of Christian doctrine and life may be
dated from the edict of Milan (313), when "unhappily, the church also
entered on an altogether new career--- that of patronage and state
protection. That which it was about to gain in material power it would
lose in moral force and independence." It is probable that the beginning
of the conventual life of women from which grew the nunneries and
convents that covered Christendom in the succeeding centuries, was with
Helen, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, who in 331 closed a pious
life at the age of eighty years. She was accustomed to gather the
virgins of the church to repasts, serving them with her own hands at
table and praying in their company.

Robertson says: "Theophilus succeeded Timothy at Alexandria in 385, and
held the see till 412. He was able, bold, crafty, unscrupulous, corrupt,
rapacious, domineering. In the first controversy between Jerome and
Rufinus he had acted the creditable part of a mediator. His own
inclinations were undoubtedly in favor of Origen; he had even deposed a
bishop named Paul for his hostility to that teacher, but he now found it
expedient to adopt a different line of conduct." Jerome and Theophilus
subsequently joined hands and united in a bitter and relentless warfare
against the great Alexandrian. There seems to have been very little
principle in the course they pursued.

## Jerome.

Jerome --- 331-420 --- was one of the ablest of the fathers of the
century in which he lived --- "the most learned except Origen," up to
his time. He wrote in Latin, and was contemporary with Augustine, but
did not accept all the Paganism of the great corruptor of Christianity.
He stood in line with his Oriental predecessors. At first he was an
enthusiastic partisan of Origen, but later, when opposition to the great
Alexandrian set in, he became an equally violent opponent. Schaff says
he was a great trimmer and time server, and at length seemed to
acquiesce in the growing influence of Augustinianism. Jerome had
\'"originally belonged, like the friend of his youth, Rufinus, and John,
Bishop of Jerusalem, to the warmest admirers of the great Alexandrian
father.[^381] But attacked as he now was, with remonstrances from
different sides, he began out of anxiety for his own reputation for
orthodoxy, to separate himself with the utmost care from the heresies
with which he was charged." One of Origen\'s works, in the handwriting
of Pamphilus, came into Jerome\'s possession, who says, owning it, he
"owns the wealth of Croesus; it is signed, as it were, with the very
blood of the martyr."

Jerome translated fourteen homilies of Origen on Jeremiah, and fourteen
on Ezekiel, and quotes Didymus as saying that Origen was the greatest
teacher of the church since St. Paul. During his residence in Rome
Jerome highly praised Origen, but soon after, when he found himself
accused of heresy for so doing, he declared that he had only read him as
he had read other heretics. In a letter to Vigiliantius he says: "I
praise him as an interpreter, not as a dogmatic teacher; for his genius,
not for his faith; as a philosopher, not as an apostle.... If you
believe me, I never was an Origenist; if you do not believe me, I have
now ceased to be one."[^382] But when in Caesarea he borrowed the
manuscript of Origen\'s Hexapla and collated it, and in Alexandria he
passed a month with the great Universalist, the blind Didymus.

It is curious to notice, however, that Jerome does not oppose Origen\'s
universal restoration, but erroneously accuses him of advocating the
universal equality of the restored --- of holding that Gabriel and the
devil, Paul and Caiaphas, the virgin and the prostitute, will be alike
in the immortal world. The idea of the universal restoration of mankind,
divested of pre-existence, universal equality, the salvability of evil
spirits, etc., does not seem to have been much objected to in the days
of Jerome, even by those who did not accept it.

### Jerome's Politic Course.

Jerome\'s later language is: "And though Origen declares that no
rational being will be lost, and gives penitence to the evil one, what
is that to us who believe that the evil one and his satellites, and all
the wicked will perish eternally, and that Christians, *if they have
been cut off in sin, shall after punishment be saved.*" This, however,
was after the cautious and politic churchman had begun to hedge in order
to conciliate the growing influence of Augustinianism. And the words
italicized above show that his endless punishment was very elastic.

Jerome uses the word rendered eternal in the Bible (*aionios*) in the
sense of limited duration, as that Jerusalem was burnt with *aionian*
fire by Hadrian; that Israel experienced *aionian* woe, etc. In his
commentary on Isaiah his language is:

"Those who think that the punishment of the wicked will one day, after
many ages, have an end, rely on these testimonies: Rom. 11:25; Gal.
3:22; Mic. 7:9; Isa. 12:1; Ps. 30:20," which he quotes, and adds: "And
this we ought to leave to the knowledge of God alone, whose torments, no
less than his compassion, are in due measure, and who knows how and how
long to punish. This only let us say as suiting our human frailty,
'Lord, rebuke me not in your fury, nor chasten me in your anger.'"[^383]

Commenting on Isaiah 24, he says: "This seems to favor those friends of
mine who grant the grace of repentance to the devil and to demons after
many ages, that they too shall be visited after a time.... Human frailty
cannot know the judgment of God, nor venture to form an opinion of the
greatness and the measure of his punishment."

Jerome frequently exposes his sympathy with the doctrine of restoration,
as when he says: "Israel and all heretics, because they had the works of
Sodom and Gomorrah, are overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah, that they
may be set free like a brand snatched from the burning. And this is the
meaning of the prophet\'s words, 'Sodom shall be restored as of old,'
that he who by his vice is as an inhabitant of Sodom, after the works of
Sodom have been burnt in him, may be restored to his ancient
state."[^384]

In quoting from this father, Allin says, in *Universalism Asserted*:
"Nor are these isolated instances; I have found nearly one hundred
passages in his works (and there are doubtless others) indicating
Jerome\'s sympathy with Universalism. Further, we should note that when
towards the year 400 AD, Jerome took part with Epiphanius and the
disreputable Theophilus against Origen (whom he had hitherto
extravagantly praised), he, as Huet points out, kept a significant
silence on the question of human restoration. 'Though you adduce,' says
Huet, 'six hundred testimonies, you thereby only prove that he changed
his opinion.' But did he ever change his opinion? And if so, how far?
Thus in his *Epis. ad Avit*., where he goes at length into Origen\'s
errors, he says nothing of the larger hope; and when charged with
Origenism he refers time over to his commentaries on Ephesians, which
teach the most outspoken Universalism. As a specimen of his praise of
Origen, he says, in a letter to Paula that Origen was blamed, 'not on
account of the novelty of his doctrines, not on account of heresy, as
now mad dogs pretend, but from jealousy,' so that to call Origen a
heretic is the part of a mad dog! Note this, from the most orthodox
Jerome."

### A Miserable Story.

Translating Origen\'s *Homilies*, which affirm Universalism continually,
he said in his preface, that Origen was only inferior to the
Apostles.[^385] The manner in which he retracted these sentiments and
became the detractor and enemy of the man to whom he had admitted his
indebtedness is disgraceful to his memory. Farrar accurately calls the
record of his behavior "a miserable story." Jerome\'s morbid dread of
being held to be heretical, led him, it is feared, to deny some of his
real opinions, and to violently attack those who held them, in order to
divert attention from himself.[^386]

A few of his expressions are here given out of the many quotable. On
Ephesians 4:6: "In the end of things, the whole body which had been
dissipated and torn into divers parts shall be restored. Let us
understand the whole number of rational creatures under the figure of a
single rational animal. Let us imagine this animal to be torn so that no
bone adheres to bone, nor nerve to nerve.... in the restitution of all
things when Christ the true physician shall have come to heal the body
of the universal church ... every one ... shall receive his proper
place.... What I mean is, the fallen angel will begin to be that which
he was created, and man who has been expelled from Paradise will be once
more restored to the tilling of Paradise.... These things then will take
place universally."

On Micah 5:8: "Death shall come as a visitor to the impious; it will not
be perpetual it will not annihilate them; but will prolong its visit
till the impiety which is in them shall be consumed."

On Ephesians 4:13, he says: "The question should arise who those are of
whom he says that they all shall come into the unity of the faith? Does
he mean all men, or all the saints, or all rational beings? He appears
to me to be speaking of all men."

On John 17:21: "In the end and consummation of the Universe all are to
be restored into their original harmonious state, and we all shall be
made one body and be united once more into a perfect man, and the prayer
of our Savior shall be fulfilled that all may be one."

In his homily on Jonah he says: "Most persons (*plerique*, very many),
regard the story of Jonah as teaching the ultimate forgiveness of all
rational creatures, even the devil." This shows us the prevalence of the
doctrine in the Fourth Century. His words are: "The apostate angels, and
the prince of this world, and Lucifer, the morning star, though now
ungovernable, licentiously wandering about, and plunging themselves into
the depths of sin shall in the end, embrace the happy dominion of Christ
and his saints."

Gieseler quotes the following sentence from Jerome\'s comments on
Galatians 5:22: "No rational creature before God will perish forever,"
and from this language the historian not only classes Jerome as a
Universalist, but considers it proof that the doctrine was then
prevalent in the West. "The learned, the famous Jerome (AD 380-390), was
at this time a Universalist of Origen\'s school. He was, indeed, a Latin
writer; but it may be more proper to introduce him with the Greek
fathers, since he completed his theological education in the East, and
there spent the larger part of his manhood and old age. A follower of
Origen, from whose works he borrowed without reserve, he nevertheless
modified his scheme of universal salvation with little amendment... At a
later period he was led, by a theological and personal quarrel, to take
sides against this doctrine."[^387]

## John Chrysostom.

John Chrysostom, 347-407, was born of Christian parentage in Antioch,
and became the golden-mouthed orator and one of the most celebrated of
the fathers. He was the intimate friend of Theodore of Mopsuestia, and
Diodore of Tarsus, and a pupil of the latter for six years. He was no
controversialist, his works are chiefly expository and hortatory. His
praise of his Universalist friends, Theodore and Diodore, should
predispose us to regard him as cherishing their view of human destiny,
notwithstanding his lurid descriptions of the horrors of future
torments.

### Chrysostom's Views.

In answer to the question, "Whether hell fire have any end," Chrysostom
says, "Christ declares that it has no end. Well," he adds, "I know that
a chill comes over you on hearing these things, but what am I to do? For
this is God\'s own command, ... that it has no end Christ has declared.
Paul also says, in pointing out the eternity of punishment, that the
sinner shall pay the penalty of destruction, and that forever."[^388]
The reasonableness of the apparently disproportioned penalty he feebly
argues. A specimen of the utter inadequacy of his argument is seen where
he comments on the language, "If any man\'s work be burned he shall
suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire." He says
it means "that while the sinner\'s works shall perish, he shall be
preserved in fire for the purpose of torment." And he gives the very
details: "A river of fire, and a poisonous worm, and darkness
interminable, and undying tortures."[^389] And yet he asks with a
significant emphasis that seems to preclude the thought of the sinner\'s
irremediably suffering: "Tell me on what account do you mourn for him
that is departed? Is it because he was wicked? But for that very reason
you ought to give thanks, because his evil works are put a stop to."
"God is equally to be praised when he chastises, and when he frees from
chastisement. For both spring from goodness.... It is right, then, to
praise him equally both for placing Adam in Paradise, and for expelling
him; and to give thanks not alone for the kingdom, but for Gehenna as
well.... Christ went to the utterly black and joyless portion of Hades,
and turned it into heaven, transferring all its wealth, the race of man,
into his royal treasury."[^390]

### Neander and Schaff.

Dr. Schaff informs us that "Nitzsch includes Gregory Nazianzen and
possibly Chrysostom among Universalists, and says that Chrysostom
praised Origen and Diodorus, and this comments on 1 Cor. 15:28, looked
toward an *apokalastasis*."

Dr. Beecher ranks him among the "esoteric believers." Neander thinks he
believed in Universalism but felt that the opposite doctrine was
necessary to alarm the multitude. On the words, "At the name of Jesus
every knee shall bow," Chrysostom says: "What does this mean of 'things
in heaven, on earth, and under the earth?' It means the whole world, and
angels, and men, and demons. Or, it signifies both the holy and
sinners."

A pupil of Diodore, of Tarsus, for six years, and a fellow-student with
Theodore of Mopsuestia, both Universalists, he cannot be regarded as
otherwise than in sympathy with them on this theme of themes. He must
have been one of those esoteric believers elsewhere described, for he
says according to Neander, that he had found the doctrine of endless
punishment necessary to the welfare of sinners, and on that account had
preached it. The influence of the Alexandrians was waning, and the
heathen environment was leavening Christianity, which soon assumed a
phase wholly foreign to its primal purity.

# 20. Augustine (Deterioration Continues). 

Aurelius Augustinus was bom in Tagaste, Numidia, November 13, 354, and
died in 420. He was the great fountain of error destined to adulterate
Christianity and change its character for long ages. In disposition and
spirit he was wholly unlike the amiable and learned fathers who
proclaimed an earlier and purer faith. He fully developed that change in
opinion which was destined to influence Christianity for many centuries.
He himself informs us that he spent his youth in the brothels of
Carthage after a mean, thieving boyhood.[^391] He cast off the mother of
his illegitimate son, Adeodatus, whom he ought to have married, as his
sainted mother, Monica, urged him to do. It is an interesting indication
of the Latin type of piety to know that his mother allowed him to live
at home during his shameless life, but that when he adopted the
Manichaean heresy she forbade him her house. And afterward, when he
became "orthodox," though still living immorally, she received him in
her home. His life was destitute of the claims of that paternal relation
on which society rests, and which our Lord makes the fundamental fact of
his religion, Fatherhood. He transferred to God the characteristics of
semi-Pagan kings, and his theology was a hybrid born of the Roman Code
of Law and Pagan Mythology.

The contrast between Origen\'s system and Augustine\'s is as that of
light and darkness; with the first, Fatherhood, Love, Hope, Joy,
Salvation; with the other, Vengeance, Punishment, Sin, Eternal Despair.
With Origen God triumphs in final unity; with Augustine man continues in
endless rebellion, and God is defeated, and an eternal dualism prevails.
And the effect on the believer was in the one case a pitying love and
charity that gave the melting heart that could not bear to think of even
the devil unsaved, and that antedated the poet\'s prayer, ---

"Oh, wad ye tak a thought and mend,"[^392] and that believed the prayer
would be answered; and in the other a stony-hearted indifference to the
misery of mankind, which he called "one damned batch and mass of
perdition."[^393]

## Augustine's Acknowledgment.

Augustine brought his theology with him from Manichaeism when he became
a Christian, only he added perpetuity to the dualism that Mani made
temporal. "The doctrine of endless punishment assumed in the writings of
Augustine a prominence and rigidity which had no parallel in the earlier
history of theology ... and which savors of the teaching of Mohammed
more than of Christ.[^394] Hitherto, even in the West, it had been an
open question whether the punishment hereafter of sin unrepented of and
not forsaken was to be endless. Augustine has left on record the fact
that some, indeed very many, still fell back upon the mercy and love of
God as a ground of hope for the ultimate restoration of humanity[^395]
... he is the first writer to undertake a long and elaborate defense of
the doctrine of endless punishment, and to wage a polemic against its
impugners.... He rallies the 'tender-hearted Christians,' as he calls
them, who cannot accept it.\" About 420 he speaks of his "merciful
brethren,"[^396] or party of pity, among the orthodox Christians, who
advocate the salvation of all, and he challenges them, like Origen, to
advocate also the redemption of the devil and his angels. Thus though
the virus of Roman Paganism was extending, the truth of the Gospel was
yet largely held. And it was the immense power Augustine came to wield
that so dominated the church that it afterwards stamped out the doctrine
of universal salvation.

## Augustine's Criticisms and Mistakes.

Augustine assumed and insisted that the words defining the duration of
punishment, in the New Testament, teach its endlessness, and the claim
set up by Augustine is the one still held by the advocates of "the dying
belief," that *aeternus* in the Latin, and *aionios* in the original
Greek, mean interminable duration. It seems that a Spanish presbyter,
Orosius, visited Augustine in the year 413, and besought him for
arguments to meet the position that punishment is not to be without end,
because *aionios* does not denote eternal, but limited duration.
Augustine replied that though *aion* signifies limited as well as
endless duration, the Greeks only used *aionios* for endless; and he
originated the argument so much resorted to even yet, based on the fact
that in Matthew 25:46, the same word is applied to "life," and to
"punishment." The student of Greek need not be told that Augustine\'s
argument is incorrect, and he scarcely needs to be assured that
Augustine did not know Greek. This he confesses. He says he hates
Greek," and the "grammar learning of the Greeks."[^397] It is anomalous
in the history of criticism that generations of scholars should take
their cue in a matter of Greek definition from one who admits that he
had "learned almost nothing of Greek," and was "not competent to read
and understand" the language, and reject the positions held by those who
were born Greeks! That such a man should contradict and subvert the
teachings of such men as Clement, Origen, the Gregories and others whose
mother-tongue was Greek, is passing strange. But his powerful influence,
aided by the civil arm, established his doctrine till it came to rule
the centuries. Augustine always quotes the New Testament from the old
Latin version, the *Itala*, from which the Vulgate was formed, instead
of the original Greek.[^398] It seems that the doctrine of Origen
prevailed in Northeastern Spain at this time, and that Jerome\'s
translation of Origen\'s *Principiis* had circulated with good effect,
and that Augustine, to counteract the influence of Origen\'s book, wrote
in 415, a small work, *Against the Priscillianists and Origenists*. From
about this time began the efforts of Augustine and his followers that
subsequently entirely changed the character of Christian theology.

## Milman on Augustinianism.

Says Milman: "The Augustinian theology coincided with the tendencies of
the age towards the growth of the strong sacerdotal system; and the
sacerdotal system reconciled Christendom with the Augustinian theology."
And it was in the age of Augustine, at the maturity of his powers, that
the Latin church developed its theological system, "differing at every
point from the earlier Greek theology, starting from different premises,
and actuated throughout by another motive,"[^399] and from that time,
for nearly fifteen centuries it held sway, and for more than a thousand
years the sentiment of Christendom was little more or less than the echo
of the voice of Augustine. "When Augustine appeared the Greek tongue was
dying out, the Greek spirit was waning, the Paganism of Rome and its
civil genius were combined, and a Roman emperor usurped the throne of
the God of love."[^400]

Augustine declared that God had no kind purpose in punishing; that it
would not be unjust to torment all souls forever; a few are saved to
illustrate God\'s mercy. The majority "are predestinated to eternal fire
with the devil." He held, however, that all punishments beyond the grave
are not endless.[^401]

## Augustine Less Severe Than Modern Orthodoxy.

Augustine, however, held the penalties of sin in a much milder form than
do his degenerate theological descendants in modern times. He teaches
that the lost still retain goodness, --- too valuable to be destroyed,
and on that account the worst are not in absolute evil, but only in a
lower degree of good. "Grief for lost good in a state of punishment is a
witness of a good nature. For he who grieves for the lost peace for his
nature, grieves for it by means of some remains of peace, by which it is
caused that nature should be friendly to itself." He taught that while
unbaptized children must be damned in a Gehenna of fire, their torments
would be light (*levissima*) compared with the torment of other sinners,
and that their condition would be far preferable to non-existence, and
so on the whole a blessing. In a *limbus infantum* they would only
receive a *mitissima damnatio*. He also taught that death did not
necessarily end probation, as is quite fully shown under \"Christ\'s
Descent into Hades.\" Augustine\'s idea was reduced to rhyme in the
sixteenth century by the Rev. Michael Wigglesworth, of Maiden, Mass.,
who was the Puritan pastor of the church in that place. A curious fact
in the history of the parish is this, --- that the church in which these
ridiculous sentiments were uttered became, in 1828, by vote of the
parish, Universalist, and is now the Universalist church in Maiden. The
poem represents God as saying to non-elect infants:

> "You sinners are, and such a share
>
> As sinners may expect,

Such you shall have, for I do save

> None but my own elect.

Yet to compare your sin with theirs

> Who lived a longer time,
>
> I do confess yours is much less
>
> Though every sin\'s a crime.

A crime it is, therefore in bliss

> You may not hope to dwell,

But unto you I shall allow

> The easiest room in hell!"

Augustine thought that the cleansing fire might burn away venial sins
between death and the resurrection. He says: "I do not refute it,
because, perhaps, it is true;"[^402] and that the sins of the good may
be eradicated by a similar process.

He was certainly an example that might advantageously have been copied
by opponents of Universalism in very recent years. Though he said the
church "detested" it, he kindly added: "They who believe this, and yet
are Catholics, seem to me to be deceived by a certain human tenderness,"
and he urged Jerome to continue to translate Origen for the benefit of
the African church!

## Decadence and Deterioration.

Under such malign influences, however, the broad and generous theology
of the East soon passed away; the language in which it was expressed ---
the language of Clement, Origen, Basil, the Gregories, became unknown
among the Christians of the West; the cruel doctrines of Augustine
harmonized with the cruelty of the barbarians and of Roman Paganism
amalgamated, and thus Africa[^403] smothered the milder spirit of
Christendom, and Augustine riveted the fetters that were to manacle the
church for more than ten long centuries. "The triumph of Latin theology
was the death of rational exegesis."

But before this evil influence prevailed, some of the great Latin
fathers rivaled the immortal leaders in the Oriental church. Among these
was Ambrose, of whom Jerome says, "nearly all his books are full of
Origenism," which Huet repeats, while the *Dictionary of Christian
Biography* tells us that he teaches that "even to the wicked death is a
gain." Thus the genial thought of Origen was still potent, even in the
West, though a harder theology was overcoming it.

Says Hagenbach: "In proportion to the development of ecclesiastical
orthodoxy into fixed and systematic shape was the loss of individual
freedom in respect to the formation of doctrines, and the increased
peril of becoming heretical. The more liberal tendency of former
theologians, such as Origen, could no longer be tolerated, and was at
length condemned. But, notwithstanding this external condemnation, the
spirit of Origen continued to animate the chief theologians of the East,
though it was kept within narrower limits. The works of this great
teacher were also made known in the West by Jerome and Rufinus, and
exerted an influence even upon his opponents.\"

After Justinian the Greek empire and influence contracted, and the Latin
and Roman power expanded. Latin became the language of Christianity, and
Augustine\'s system and followers used it as the instrument of molding
Christianity into an Africo-Romano heathenism. The Apostles\' and Nicene
creeds were disregarded, and Arianism, Origenism, Pelagianism,
Manichaeism and other so-called heresies were nearly or quite
obliterated, and the Augustinian inventions of original and inherited
depravity, predestination, and endless hell torments, became the
theology of Christendom.

## Christianity Plagiarized.

Thus, says Schaff, "the Roman state, with its laws, institutions, and
usages, was still deeply rooted in heathenism. The Christianizing of the
state amounted therefore to a paganizing and secularizing of the church.
The world overcame the church as much as the church overcame the world,
and the temporal gain of Christianity was in many respects canceled by
spiritual loss. The mass of the Roman Empire was baptized only with
water, not with the spirit and fire of the Gospel, and it smuggled
heathen practices and manners into the sanctuary under a new name." The
broad faith of the primitive Christians paled and faded before the lurid
terrors of Augustinianism. It vanished in the Sixth Century, "crushed
out," says Bigg, "by tyranny and the leaden ignorance of the age. It
remained in the East a while, was "widely diffused among the monasteries
of Egypt and Palestine," and only ceased when Augustinianism and
Catholicism and the power of Rome ushered in and fostered the darkness
of the Dark Ages.

Says an accurate writer: "If Augustine had not been born an African, and
trained as a Manichee, nay, if he had only faced the labor of learning
Greek --- a labor from which he confesses that he had shrunk --- the
whole stream of Christian theology might have been purer and more
sweet."

## Augustinianism Cruel.

In no other respect did Augustine differ more widely from Origen and the
Alexandrians than in his intolerant spirit. Even Tertullian conceded to
all the right of opinion. Gregory of Nazianzus, Ambrose, Athanasius and
Augustine himself in his earlier days, recorded the tolerance that
Christianity demands. But he afterwards came to advocate and defend the
persecution of religious opponents.

Milman observes: \"With shame and horror we hear from Augustine himself
that fatal axiom which impiously arrayed cruelty in the garb of
Christian charity.\"[^404] He was the first in the long line of
Christian persecutors and illustrates the character of the theology that
swayed him in the wicked spirit that impelled him to advocate the right
to persecute Christians who differ from those in power. The dark pages
that bear the record of subsequent centuries are a damning witness to
the cruel spirit that actuated Christians, and the cruel theology that
impelled it. Augustine "was the first and ablest asserter of the
principle which led to Albigensian crusades, Spanish armadas,
Netherland\'s butcheries, St. Bartholomew massacres, the accursed
infamies of the Inquisition, the vile espionage, the hideous bale fires
of Seville and Smithfield, the racks, the gibbets, the thumbscrews, the
subterranean torture-chambers used by churchly torturers."[^405] And
George Sand well says that the Roman church committed suicide the day
she invented an implacable God and eternal damnation.[^406]

# 21. Unsuccessful Attempts to Suppress Universalism.

Historians and writers on the state of opinion in the early church have
quite often erred in declaring that an ecclesiastical council pronounced
the doctrine of universal salvation heretical, as early as the Sixth
Century. Even so learned and accurate a writer as our own Dr. Ballou,
has fallen into this error, though his editor, the Rev. A. St. John
Chambré, D. D., subsequently corrected the mistake in a brief note.

In 399 a council in Jerusalem condemned the Origenists, and all who held
with them, that the Son was in any way subordinate to the Father. In 401
a council in Alexandria anathematized the writings of Origen, presumably
for the same reason as above. Certainly his views of human destiny were
not mentioned.

In 544-6, a condemnation of Origen\'s views of human salvation was
attempted to be extorted from a small, local council in Constantinople,
by the emperor Justinian, but his edict was not obeyed by the council.
He issued an edict to Mennas, patriarch of Constantinople, requiring him
to assemble the bishops resident, or casually present there, to condemn
the doctrine of universal restoration. Fulminating ten anathemas, he
especially urged Mennas to anathematize the doctrine "that wicked men
and devils will at length be discharged from their torments, and
re-established in their original state."[^407] He wrote to Mennas
requiring him to frame a canon in these words:

"\'Whoever says or thinks that the torments of the demons and of impious
men are temporal, so that they will at length come to an end, or whoever
holds to a restoration either of the demons or of the impious, let him
be anathema."

## Justinian's Views.

It is conceded that the half-heathen emperor held to the idea of endless
misery, for he proceeds not only to defend, but to define the
doctrine.[^408] He does not merely say, "We believe in *aionion
kolasin*;" for that was just what Origen himself taught. Nor does he say
"the word *aionion* has been misunderstood; it denotes endless
duration," as he would have said, had there been such a disagreement.
But, writing in Greek, with all the words of that copious language from
which to choose, he says: "The holy church of Christ teaches an endless
*aeonian* (*ateleutetos aionios*) life to the righteous, and endless
(*ateleutetos*) punishment to the wicked.\" If he supposed *aionios*
denoted endless duration, he would not have added the stronger word to
it. The fact that he qualified it by *ateleutetos*, demonstrated that as
late as the sixth century the former word did not signify endless
duration.

Justinian need only to have consulted his contemporary, Olympiodorus,
who wrote on this very subject, to vindicate his language. In his
commentary on the *Meteorologica of Aristotle*,[^409] he says: "Do not
suppose that the soul is punished for endless ages[^410] in Tartarus.
Very properly the soul is not punished to gratify the revenge of the
divinity, but for the sake of healing. But we say that the soul is
punished for an *aeonian* period, calling its life, and its allotted
period of punishment, its *aeon*." It will be noticed that he not only
denies endless punishment and denies that the doctrine can be expressed
by *aionios* but declares that punishment is temporary and results in
the sinner\'s improvement. Justinian not only concedes that *aionios*
requires a word denoting endlessness to give it the sense of limitless
duration, but he insists that the council shall frame a canon containing
a word that shall indisputably express the doctrine of endless woe,
while it shall condemn those who advocate universal salvation. Now
though the emperor exerted his great influence to foist his heathen
doctrine into the Church canons, he failed; for nothing resembling it
appears in the canons enacted by the synodical council.

The synod voted fifteen canons, not one of which condemns universal
restoration.

## Home Synod Canons.

The first canon reads thus: "If anyone asserts the fabulous
pre-existence of souls, and the monstrous restitution which follows from
it, let him be anathema." This condemnation, it will be readily seen, is
not of universal salvation, but of a "monstrous" restitution based on
the soul\'s pre-existence. That this view is correct appears from the
fourteenth anathema: "If anyone says that there will be a single unity
of all rational beings, their substances and individualities being taken
away together with their bodies, and also that there will be an identity
of cognition as also of persons, and that in the fabulous restitution
they will only be naked even as they had existed in that prae-existence
which they insanely introduced, let him be anathema."

The reader will at once perceive that these canons do not describe any
genuine form of our faith, but only a distorted caricature which no
doubt was thought to represent the doctrine they opposed. But not one of
the nine anathemas ordered by Justinian was sanctioned by the council.
They were laid before the Home Synod, but the Synod did not indorse
them. Fifteen canons were passed, but the Synod refused to reprobate
universal salvation. Justinian was unable to compel the bishops under
his control to condemn the doctrine he hated, but which they must have
favored. The theory here condemned is not that of universal salvation,
but the "fabulous pre-existence of souls, and the monstrous restitution
that results from it."

The bishops, says Landon, declared that they adhered to the doctrines of
Athanasius, Basil and the Gregories. The doctrine of Theodore on the
Sonship of Christ was condemned, also the teachings of Theodoret.
"Origen was not condemned."[^411]

## The Council Refused to Condemn Universalism.

Even the influence of Justinian and his obsequious bishop, and his
disreputable queen, failed to force the measure through. The action of
this local Synod has been incorrectly ascribed to the Fifth Ecumenical
Council, nine years later, which has also been inaccurately supposed to
have condemned Universalism, when it merely reprehended some of the
vagaries of "Origenism" --- doctrines that even Origen himself never
accepted, but that were falsely ascribed to him by ignorant or malicious
opponents; doctrines that no more resemble universal restoration, as
taught by the Alexandrine fathers, than they resemble Theosophy or
Buddhism. So that, though the Home Synod was called by the Emperor
Justinian expressly to condemn Universalism, and was commanded by
imperial edict to anathematize it, and though it formulated fifteen
canons, it refused to obey the Emperor, and did not say one word against
the doctrine the Emperor wished to anathematize. The local council came
to no decision. Justinian had just arbitrarily condemned the writings of
Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Theodoret, and a terrible controversy and
division ensued, and Theodorus, of Caesarea, declared that both himself
and Pelagius, who had sought the condemnation of Origen, ought to be
burnt alive for their conduct.[^412]

In the Fifth General Council of 553 the name of Origen appears with
others in the eleventh canon, but the best scholars think that the
insertion of his name is a forgery.

Whether so or not, there is not a word referring to his views of human
destiny. His name only appears among the names of the heretics, such as
"Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinaris, Eutyches, Origen and other
impious men, and all other heretics who are condemned and anathematized
by the Catholic and Apostolical Church, etc."[^413] The Fifth Ecumenical
Council, which was held nine years later than the local, neither
condemned Origen by name, nor anathematized his Universalism. The object
of this council was to condemn certain Nestorian doctrines; and as
Gregory of Nyssa, the most explicit of Universalists, is referred to
with honor by the council, and as the denial of endless punishment by
Origen, and his advocacy of Universalism are not named, we cannot avoid
the conviction that the council was controlled by those who held, or at
least did not repudiate Universalism.

Great confusion exists among the authorities on this subject. The local
council has been confounded with the general. Hefele has disentangled
the perplexities.

## Universalism Not Condemned for Five Centuries.

It was not even at that late day --- three centuries after his death ---
the Universalism of Origen that caused the hatred of his opponents, but
his opposition to the Episcopizing policy of the church, his insisting
on the triple sense of the Word, etc., and the peculiar form of a
misstated doctrine of the restoration.[^414]

Now, let the reader remember that for more than five hundred years,
during which Universalism had prevailed, not a single treatise against
it is known to have been written. And with the exception of Augustine,
no opposition appears to have been aroused against it on the part of any
eminent Christian writer. And not only so, but in 381 AD, at the first
great Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, the intellectual leader was
Gregory of Nyssa, who was only second to Origen as an advocate of
universal restoration. Thus his followers, not only, but his opponents
on other points, accepted the great truth of the Gospel. As Dr. Beecher
pointedly observes: "It is also a striking fact that while Origen lies
under a load of odium as a heretic, Gregory of Nyssa, who taught the
doctrine of the restoration of all things more fully even than Origen,
has been canonized, and stands high on the roll of eminent saints, even
in the orthodox Roman Catholic Church." Beecher\'s conclusion is, "That
the modern orthodox views as to the doctrine of eternal punishment, as
opposed to final restoration, were not fully developed and established
till the middle of the Sixth Century, and that then they were not
established by thorough argument, but by imperial authority." But the
fact is that they were not even then matured and established.

The learned Professor Plumptre says in the *Dictionary of Christian
Biography*: "We have no evidence that the belief in the
*apokatastasis*,[^415] which prevailed in the fourth and fifth centuries
was ever definitely condemned by any council of the Church, and so far
as Origen was named as coming under the church\'s censure it was rather
as if involved in the general sentence passed upon the leaders of
Nestorianism, than singled out for special and characteristic errors. So
the council of Constantinople, the so-called Fifth General Council, in
553, condemns Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinarius, Nestorius,
Eutyches and Origen in a lump, but does not specify the errors of the
last-named, as though they differed in kind from theirs, and it is not
till in the council of Constantinople, known as in Trullo (696) that we
find an anathema which specifies somewhat cloudily the guilt of Theodore
of Mopsuestia, and Origen, and Didymus, and Evagrius, as consists in
their 'inventing a mythology after the manner of the Greeks, and
inventing changes and migrations for our souls and bodies, and impiously
uttering drunken ravings as to the future life of the dead.' It deserves
to be noted that this ambiguous anathema pronounced by a council of no
authority, under the weak and vicious Emperor Justinian II, is the only
approach to a condemnation of the eschatology of Origen which the annals
of the church councils present."[^416]

## Significant Facts and Conclusions. 

Now let the reader recapitulate:

\(1\) Origen during his lifetime was never opposed for his Universalism;

\(2\) after his death Methodius (about 300) attacked his views of the
resurrection, creation and pre-existence, but said not a word against
his Universalism;

\(3\) ten years later Pamphilus and Eusebius (310) defended him against
nine charges that had been brought against his views, but his
Universalism was not among them;

\(4\) in 330 Marcellus of Ancyra, a Universalist, opposed him for his
views of the Trinity, and

\(5\) Eustathius for his teachings concerning the Witch of Endor, but
limited their arraignment to those items;

\(6\) in 376 Epiphanius assailed his heresies, but he did not name
Universalism as among them, and in 394 he condemned Origen\'s doctrine
of the salvation of the Devil, but not of all mankind;

\(7\) in 399 and 401, his views of Christ\'s death to save the Devil
were attacked by Epiphanius, Jerome and Theophilus, and his advocacy of
the subordination of Christ to God was condemned, but not his teachings
of man\'s universal salvation; and

\(8\) it was not till 544 and again in 553 that his enemies formulated
attacks on that doctrine, and made a cat\'s-paw of a half-heathen
Emperor, and even then, though the latter framed a canon for the synod,
it was never adopted, and the council adjourned --- owing, it must have
been, to the Universalistic sentiment in it --- without a word of
condemnation of Origen\'s Universalism. With the exception of Augustine,
the doctrine which had been constantly advocated, often by the most
eminent, did not evoke a frown of opposition from any eminent scholar or
saint.

## The Ancient Councils.

The character of these ancient synods and councils is well described by
Gregory Nazianzen (382) in a letter to Procopius: "I am determined to
avoid every assembly of bishops. I have never seen a single instance in
which a synod did any good. Strife and ambition dominate them to an
incredible degree.... From councils and synods I will keep myself at a
distance, for I have experienced that most of them, to speak with
moderation, are not worth much.... I will not sit in the seat of synods,
while geese and cranes confused wrangle. Discord is there, and shameful
things, hidden before, are gathered into one meeting place of rivals."

Milman tells us: "Nowhere is Christianity less attractive, and if we
look to the ordinary tone and character of the proceedings, less
authoritative than in the Councils of the Church. It is in general a
fierce collision of rival factions, neither of which will yield, each of
which is solemnly pledged against conviction. Intrigue, injustice,
violence, decisions on authority alone, and that the authority of a
turbulent majority, decisions by wild acclamation rather than after
sober enquiry, detract from the reverence, and impugn the judgments, at
least of the later councils. The close is almost invariably a terrible
anathema, in which it is impossible not to discern the tones of human
hatred, of arrogant triumph, of rejoicing at the damnation imprecated
against the humiliated adversary."[^417] Scenes of strife and even
murder in connection with ancient ecclesiastical councils were not
uncommon.

There is no evidence whatever to show that it was not entirely allowable
for five hundred years after Christ, to entertain the belief in
universal salvation. Besides, the Council of Nice (325) had, as an
active member, Eusebius, Origen\'s apologist, a pronounced Universalist;
the Council of Constantinople (381) had as active members the two
Gregories, Nazianzus and Nyssa, the latter as outspoken a Universalist
as Origen himself; the Council of Ephesus (431) declared that Gregory
Nyssen\'s writings were the great bulwark against heresy. The fact that
the doctrine was and had been for centuries prevalent, if not the
prevailing sentiment, demonstrates that it must have been regarded as a
Christian doctrine by the members of these great councils, or they would
have fulminated against it.

How preposterous the idea that the prevailing sentiment of Christendom
was adverse to the doctrine of universal restoration even as late as the
middle of the Sixth Century, when these great, heresy-hunting bodies met
and dispersed without condemning it, even at the dictation of a
tyrannical Emperor, who expressly demanded its condemnation.

1.  Neander and Gieseler say that the name of Origen was foisted into
    the declaration of the Fifth Council by forgery at a later date.

2.  But if the condemnation was actually adopted it was of "Origenism,"
    which was synonymous with other opinions.

3.  "Origenism" could not have meant Universalism, for several of the
    leaders of the council that condemned Origenism held to universal
    restitution.

4.  Besides, the council eulogistically referred to the Gregories
    (Nazianzen and Nyssen) who were Universalists as explicit as was
    Origen. Manifestly, if the Council had meant Universalism by
    "Origenism," it would not have condemned as a deadly heresy in
    Origen what Gregory of Nyssa advocated, and anathematized the one,
    and glorified the other.

## Justinian's Suppression of the Truth.

Justinian not only commanded the council to suppress Universalism, but
he arbitrarily closed the schools in Athens, Alexandria and Antioch, and
drove out of the great church centers that theological science that had
been its glory. He had "brought the whole empire under his sway and he
wished in like manner to settle finally the law and the dogmatics of the
empire." To accomplish this evil work he found an aid in Rome, in a
"characterless Pope (*Vigilius*) who, in gratifying the emperor covered
himself with disgrace, and jeopardized his position in the Occident."
But he succeeded in inaugurating measures that extinguished the broad
faith of the greatest fathers of the church. "Henceforth," says Harnack,
"there was no longer a theological science going back to first
principles."[^418]

The historians inform us that Justinian the great opponent of
Universalism was positive, irritable, apt to change his views, and
accessible to the flatteries and influences of those who surrounded him,
yet withal, very opinionated in insisting upon any view he happened at
the time to hold, and prepared to enforce compliance by the free
employment of his despotic power, a "temporal pope."[^419] The corrupt
Bishop Theophilus, the vile Eudoxia and the equally disreputable, though
beautiful, crafty and unscrupulous Theodora, exercised a malign
influence on Justinian, the Emperor, and, thus was dictated the action
of the council described above.

## Justinian and His Age.

Milman declares: "The Emperor Justinian unites in himself the most
opposite vices, --- insatiable rapacity and lavish prodigality, intense
pride and contemptible weakness, unmeasured ambition and dastardly
cowardice. He is the uxorious slave of his Empress, whom, after she had
ministered to the licentious pleasures of the populace as a courtesan
and as an actress in the most immodest exhibitions, in defiance of
decency, of honor, of the remonstrances of his friends, and of religion,
he had made the partner of his throne. In the Christian Emperor seemed
to meet the crimes of those who won or secured their empire by the
assassination of all whom they feared, the passion for public diversions
without the accomplishments of Nero, the brute strength of Commodus, or
the dotage of Claudius." And he was the champion of endless punishment
in the Sixth Century!

Justinian is described as an ascetic, a scholastic, and a pedant,
"neither beloved in his life, nor regretted at his death."

The age of Justinian, says **Lecky**, that condemned Origen, is conceded
to have been the vilest of the Christian centuries. The doctrine of a
hell of literal fire and endless duration had begun to be an engine of
tyranny in the hands of an unscrupulous priesthood, and a tyrannical
emperor, and moral degradation had kept pace with the theological
declination. "The universal verdict of history is that it constitutes,
without a single exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form
that civilization has yet assumed." Contrasted with the age of Origen it
was as night to day. And the persons who were most active and prominent
in the condemnation of the great Alexandrian were fit implements for the
task. On this point the language of Farrar in *Mercy and Judgment* is
accurate: "Every fresh study of the original authorities only leaves on
my mind a deeper impression that even in the Fifth Century Universalism
as regards mankind was regarded as a perfectly tenable opinion."

## The Divine Light Eclipsed.

Thus the record of the times shows, and the testimony of the scholars
who have made the subject a careful study concedes, that though there
were sporadic assaults on the doctrine of universal restitution in the
fourth and fifth centuries; they were not successful in placing the ban
of a single council upon it; even to the middle of the Sixth Century. So
far as history shows the sublime fact which the great Alexandrians made
prominent--- the

> "One divine event to which the whole creation moves,"[^420]

had never been stigmatized by any considerable portion of the Christian
church for at least its first half a millennium of years.

The subsequent history of Christianity shows but too plainly that the
continued influence of Roman law and Pagan theology as incarnated in the
mighty brain of Augustine, came to dominate the Christian world, and at
length almost obliterate the faith once delivered to the saints--- the
faith that exerted so vast an influence in the church\'s earliest and
best centuries--- and spread the pall of darkness over Christendom, so
that the light of the central fact of the Gospel was scarcely seen for
sad and cruel centuries.

# 22. The Eclipse of Universalism.

The submergence of Christian Universalism in the dark waters of
Augustinian Christo-paganism, after having been the prevailing theology
of Christendom for centuries, is one of the strange phenomena in the
history of religious thought. This volume explains, in part, this
obscure phenomenon. History testifies that at the close of what
Hagenbach calls the second period, from 254 to 730, the opinion in favor
of endless punishment had become "more general." Only a few belonging to
the "Origenist humanity ... still dared to express a glimmer of hope in
favor of the damned ... the doctrine of the restitution of all things
shared the fate of Origenism, and made its appearance in after ages only
in connection with other heretical notions."

**Kingsley** attributes the decadence and deterioration of the
Alexandrine School and its doctrines and methods, to the abandonment of
its intense activity, to the relinquishment of the grand enthusiasm for
humanity that characterized Clement, Origen and their co-workers. He
says: "Having no more Heathens to fight, they began fighting each other;
... they became dogmatists ... they lost the knowledge of God, of
righteousness, and love, and peace. That Divine Logos, and theology as a
whole receded farther and farther aloft into abysmal heights, as it
became a mere dreary system of dead scientific terms, having no
practical bearing on their hearts and lives." In a word, their
abandonment of the principles of Clement and his school, left the field
open to the more practical, direct and methodical, though degraded and
corrupt theories of Augustine and his associates. This process continued
till toward the middle of the Seventh Century, when, as Kingsley
observes: "In the year 640, the Alexandrians who were tearing each other
in pieces about some Jacobite and Melchite controversy, to me
incomprehensible \... in the midst of these Jacobite and Melchite
controversies and riots, appeared before the city the armies of certain
wild and unlettered Arab tribes. A short and fruitless struggle
followed; and strange to say, a few months swept away from the face of
the earth, not only the wealth, the commerce, the castles, and the
liberty, but the philosophy and the Christianity of Alexandria; crushed
to powder, by one fearful blow, all that had been built up by Alexander
and the Ptolemies, by Clement and the philosophers, and made void, to
all appearance, nine hundred years of human toil. The people, having no
real hold on their hereditary creed, accepted, by tens of thousands,
that of the Mussulman invaders. The Christian remnant became
tributaries, and Alexandria dwindled from that time forth into a petty
seaport town.\"[^421]

The *Universalist Quarterly*, January, 1878, attributes the decline and
disappearance of Universalism to an entire absence of polemic on the
part of its advocates; and to regarding the doctrine as esoteric,
instead of for all; in other words, the undemocratic methods of those
who accepted it. These factors, no doubt, contributed, but they are not
alone sufficient to account for its disappearance.[^422]

It is not a part of the plan of this work to follow its fate after its
almost entire disappearance for centuries. The combined efforts of
Augustine and his coadjutors and successors, of popes and emperors, of
Paganism and Latin secularism, of ignorant half-converted hordes of
heathen barbarians, and of a hierarchy that could not employ it in its
ambitious schemes, at length crystallized into the pseudo-Christianity
that reigned like a nightmare over Christendom, from the Seventh to the
Fifteenth Century. Ignorance, cruelty, oppression, were well-nigh
universal, and the condition of mankind reflected the views held by the
church, of the character of God and of man, of time and of eternity, of
heaven and of hell. Perhaps the darkest hour of the night of ages was
just before the dawn of the Reformation. The prevalent Christian thought
was represented in literature and art, and its best exponents of the
sentiment of a thousand years are the works of the great artist,
**Michael Angelo**, and of the equally great poet, **Dante**. They agree
in spirit, and black and white, darkness and light, truth and falsehood
are not more antipodal than is the theology of Dante and Angelo
contrasted with the cheerful simplicity, the divine purity of the
primitive Christian faith. "That was a dark night that fell upon
Christianity when its thought became Latinized. When Christianity came
to be interpreted by the prosaic, unspiritual legal mind of Rome, the
Gospel went into a fearful eclipse. When the Greek thought of Christ
gave way to the Latin a night came upon the Christian world that has
extended to the present day. Then were born all those half-views,
distorted views, and false views of Christian doctrine and Christian
life that have perverted the Gospel, puzzled the human intellect and
grieved the human heart through all the long centuries from that day to
this."[^423]

Two great men of genius of the first order, the marvelous artist,
Michael Angelo, and the equally great poet, Dante, on canvas and in
verse, gathered at its culmination the nightmare of unbelief that had
darkened the preceding centuries. In Dante are "Christian heroes
appearing in heathenish aspect, and heathenish poets and thinkers
half-warmed by the light of Christianity," a happy characterization of
the hybrid product of truth and error that Dante describes, and that
passed for Christianity during the Sixteenth Century, and with
modifications, has since prevailed. The *Last Judgment* of Michael
Angelo harmonizes with the thought of the great poet. It is a Pagan
reminiscence --- a hideous heathen dream. The meek and lowly Man of
Nazareth who would not break the bruised reed wad travestied by a
monstrous caricature. "An unclothed, broad-shouldered hero, with arms
upraised that could strike down a Hercules, distributing blessings and
curses, his hair fluttering like flames which the storm blows back, and
his angry countenance looking down on the condemned with frightful eyes,
as if he wished to hasten forward the destruction in which his word has
plunged them ... the whole figure recalls the words of Dante, in which
he calls Christ *'Sommo Giove*,' --- the most-high Jupiter. This he is
here; not the suffering Son of Man, gentle as the moon, silent rather
than speaking, with the foreboding of his fate written in his sad eyes.
Yet, if a Last Judgment were to be painted, with everlasting
condemnation, and Christ as the judge who pronounces it, how could he
appear otherwise than in such terribleness? ... Such is Michael
Angelo\'s Last Judgment. While we cherish a feeling that at that day,
whenever it occurs, the love of God will remit all sins as earthly
error, the Roman sees alone anger and revenge, as proceeding from the
Supreme Being, when he comes in contact with humanity for the last time.
For the sinner is forever from henceforth to be condemned. It is an echo
of the old idea, often enough recurring in the Old Testament, that the
Divine Being is an angry and fearful power, which must be appeased,
instead of the Source of good alone, abolishing at last all evil as an
influence that has beguiled mankind.... As we look, however, at the Last
Judgment on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, it is no longer a similitude
to us, but a monument of the imaginative spirit of a past age and of a
strange people, whose ideas are no longer ours. Dante created a new
world for the Romanic nations by remodeling the forms of heathen
antiquity for his Christian mythology."[^424]

Materialistic, gross, was the Christianity that ruled and oppressed
mankind for nearly a thousand years, and it is reflected in the pages of
Dante, and on the canvas of Angelo, and it reverberates with ever
decreasing echoes --- thank God! --- in the subsequent creeds of
Christendom. Almost the only gleam of light that relieved while it
intensified the blackness of the darkness of Christendom during those
dreadful centuries was the worship of Mary. The resurrection of
Universalism after an eclipse of a millennium of years is as remarkable
as was its strange disappearance. No better illustration can be found
than the history of our faith gives, of the tenacity of life, the
immortality, of truth. It calls to mind the language of the German sage,
Schopenhauer: "Doubtless error can play its part, like owls in the
night. But we should sooner expect the owls to cause the terrified sun
to retire to the East, than to see the truth, once proclaimed, to be so
repressed as that ancient error might recover its lost ground, and
re-establish itself there in peace." To truth belong "God\'s eternal
years," and her emergence after so long a disappearance is an
illustration of her immortal vitality. "Crushed to earth" she has "risen
again," and is fast being accepted by a regenerated Christendom.

With the invention of printing, the dawn of light in the
Reformation,[^425] and the increase of intelligence, our distinctive
form of faith has not only grown and extended, but its leavening power
has modified the creeds of Christendom, softening all harsh theories,
and unfolding a "rose of dawn" in all Christian lands. Though, like its
author and revealer, it seemed to die, it was, like him, to come forth
to a new and glorious resurrection, for the views held by the great
saints and scholars in the first centuries of Christianity were
substantially those that are taught by the Universalist Church for the
current century, so far as they include the character of God, the nature
and final destiny of mankind, the resurrection, the judgment, the
purpose and end of punishment, and other cognate themes. On these
subjects the great Church fathers stand as representatives of the
Universalism of today, so that the progress of Christian ideas that the
end of the present century is witnessing, is not, as many think, towards
something new, but is towards the position of the early Christians
seventeen hundred years ago. It is a rebirth, a restoration of
Christianity to its primitive purity. As Max Muller has recently
written: "If we want to be true and honest Christians, we must go back
to those earliest ante-Nicene authorities, the true fathers of the
church."[^426] This is being done by Christians in all branches of the
church. The Bible, which the hands of ignorance has overwritten into a
hideous palimpsest, is being read with something of its divine meaning,
and as increasing light pours upon the sacred page, more and more men
are learning to spell its blessed messages correctly, as they were
spoken or written at the beginning --- as the ante-Nicene fathers read
them --- in harmony with man\'s intellectual, moral and affectional
nature, and with the character and attributes of the Universal Father.

# 23. Summary of Conclusions.

A few of the many points established in the foregoing pages may here be
named:

\(1\) During the First Century the primitive Christians did not dwell on
matters of eschatology but devoted their attention to apologetics; they
were chiefly anxious to establish the fact of Christ\'s advent, and of
its blessings to the world. Possibly the question of destiny was an open
one, till Paganism and Judaism introduced erroneous ideas, when the New
Testament doctrine of the *apokatastasis* was asserted, and universal
restoration became the accepted belief, as stated later by Clement and
Origen (180-230).

\(2\) The Catacombs give us the views of the unlearned, as Clement and
Origen state the doctrine of scholars and teachers. Not a syllable is
found hinting at the horrors of Augustinianism, but the inscription on
every monument harmonizes with the Universalism of the early fathers.

\(3\) Clement declares that all punishment, however severe, is
purificatory; that even the "torments of the damned" are curative.
Origen explains even Gehenna as signifying limited and curative
punishment, and both, as all the other ancient Universalists, declare
that "everlasting" (*aionion*) punishment, is consonant with universal
salvation. So that it is no proof that other primitive Christians who
are less explicit as to the final result, taught endless punishment when
they employ the same terms.

\(4\) Like our Lord and his Apostles, the primitive Christians avoided
the words with which the Pagans and Jews defined endless punishment
*aidios* or *adialeipton timoria* (endless torment), a doctrine the
latter believed, and knew how to describe; but they, the early
Christians, called punishment, as did our Lord, *kolasis aionios*,
discipline, chastisement, of indefinite, limited duration.

\(5\) The early Christians taught that Christ preached the Gospel to the
dead, and for that purpose descended into Hades. Many held that he
released all who were held there.[^427] This shows that repentance
beyond the grave, perpetual probation, was then accepted, which
precludes the modern error that the soul\'s destiny is decided at death.

\(6\) Prayers for the dead were universal in the early church, which
would be absurd, if their condition is unalterably fixed at the grave.

\(7\) The idea that false threats were necessary to keep the common
people in check, and that the truth might be held esoterically,
prevailed among the earlier Christians, so that there can be no doubt
that many who seem to teach endless punishment, really held the broader
views, as we know most did, and preached terrors pedagogically.

\(8\) The first comparatively complete systematic statement of Christian
doctrine ever given to the world was by Clement of Alexandria (180) and
universal salvation was one of the tenets.

\(9\) The first complete presentation of Christianity as a system was by
Origen (220) and universal salvation was explicitly contained in it.

\(10\) Universal salvation was the prevailing doctrine in Christendom as
long as Greek, the language of the New Testament, was the language of
Christendom.

\(11\) Universalism was generally believed in the best centuries, the
first three, when Christians were most remarkable for simplicity,
goodness, and missionary zeal.

\(12\) Universalism was least known when Greek, the language of the New
Testament was least known, and when Latin was the language of the Church
in its darkest, most ignorant, and corrupt ages.

\(13\) Not a writer among those who describe the heresies of the first
three hundred years intimates that Universalism was then a heresy,
though it was believed by many, if not by a majority, and certainly by
the greatest of the fathers.

\(14\) Not a single creed for five hundred years expresses any idea
contrary to universal restoration, or in favor of endless punishment.

\(15\) With the exception of the arguments of Augustine (420), there is
not an argument known to have been framed against Universalism for at
least four hundred years after Christ, by any of the ancient fathers.

\(16\) While the councils that assembled in various parts of
Christendom, anathematized every kind of doctrine supposed to be
heretical, no ecumenical council, for more than five hundred years,
condemned Universalism, though it had been advocated in every century by
the principal scholars and most revered saints.

\(17\) As late as 400, Jerome says "most people" (*plerique*) and
Augustine "very many" (*quam plurimi*), believed in Universalism,
notwithstanding that the tremendous influence of Augustine, and the
mighty power of the semi-pagan secular arm were arrayed against it.

\(18\) The principal ancient Universalists were Christian born and
reared and were among the most scholarly and saintly of all the ancient
saints.

\(19\) The most celebrated of the earlier advocates of endless
punishment were heathen born and led corrupt lives in their youth.
Tertullian one of the first, and Augustine, the greatest of them,
confess to having been among the vilest.

\(20\) The first advocates of endless punishment, Minucius Felix,
Tertullian and Augustine, were Latins, ignorant of Greek, and less
competent to interpret the meaning of Greek Scriptures than were the
Greek scholars.

\(21\) The first advocates of Universalism, after the Apostles, were
Greeks, in whose mother-tongue the New Testament was written. They found
their Universalism in the Greek Bible. Who should be correct, they or
the Latins?

\(22\) The Greek Fathers announced the great truth of universal
restoration in an age of darkness, sin, and corruption. There was
nothing to suggest it to them in the world's literature or religion. It
was wholly contrary to everything around them. Where else could they
have found it, but where they say they did, in the Gospel?[^428]

\(23\) All ecclesiastical historians and the best Biblical critics and
scholars agree to the prevalence of Universalism in the earlier
centuries.

\(24\) From the days of Clement of Alexandria to those of Gregory of
Nyssa and Theodore of Mopsuestia (180-428), the great theologians and
teachers, almost without exception, were Universalists. No equal number
in the same centuries were comparable to them for learning and goodness.

\(25\) The first theological school in Christendom, that in Alexandria,
taught Universalism for more than two hundred years.

\(26\) In all Christendom, from 170 to 430, there were six Christian
schools. Of these four, the only strictly theological schools, taught
Universalism, and but one endless punishment.

\(27\) The three earliest Gnostic sects, the Basilidians, the
Carpocratians and the Valentinians (117-132) are condemned by Christian
writers, and their heresies pointed out, but though they taught
Universalism, that doctrine is never condemned by those who oppose them.
Irenaeus condemned the errors of the Carpocratians, but does not
reprehend their Universalism, though he ascribes the doctrine to them.

\(28\) The first defense of Christianity against Infidelity (Origen's
*Against Celsus*) puts the defense on Universalistic grounds. Celsus
charged the Christians' God with cruelty because he punished with fire.
Origen replied that God's fire is curative; that he is a "Consuming
Fire," because he consumes sin and not the sinner.

\(29\) Origen, the chief representative of Universalism in the ancient
centuries, was bitterly opposed and condemned for various heresies by
ignorant and cruel fanatics. He was accused of opposing Episcopacy,
believing in pre-existence, etc. but never was condemned for his
Universalism. The very council that anathematized "Origenism" eulogized
Gregory of Nyssa, who was as explicitly a Universalist as was Origen.
Lists of his errors are given by Methodius, Pamphilus and Eusebius,
Marcellus, Eustathius and Jerome, but Universalism is not named by one
of his opponents. Fancy a list of Ballou\'s errors and his Universalism
omitted; Hippolytus (320) names thirty-two known heresies, but
Universalism is not mentioned as among them. Epiphanius, "the hammer of
heretics," describes eighty heresies, but he does not mention universal
salvation, though Gregory of Nyssa, an outspoken Universalist, was, at
the time he wrote, the most conspicuous figure in Christendom.

\(30\) Justinian, a half-pagan emperor, who attempted to have
Universalism officially condemned, lived in the most corrupt epoch of
the Christian centuries. He closed the theological schools and demanded
the condemnation of Universalism by law; but the doctrine was so
prevalent in the church that the council refused to obey his edict to
suppress it. Lecky says the age of Justinian was "the worst form
civilization has assumed."

\(31\) The first clear and definite statement of human destiny by any
Christian writer after the days of the Apostles, includes universal
restoration, and that doctrine was advocated by most of the greatest and
best of the Christian Fathers for the first five hundred years of the
Christian Era.

In one word, a careful study of the early history of the Christian
religion, will show that the doctrine of universal restoration was least
prevalent in the darkest, and prevailed most in the most enlightened, of
the earliest centuries --- that it was the prevailing doctrine in the
Primitive Christian Church.

## Allin, Thomas (Rev.)

## Arnold, Matthew

## Ballou, Hosea (Dr.)

Born April 30, 1771. He was raised in a Calvinistic Baptist congregation
his father pastored and was largely self-educated. Influenced by Ethan
Allen's Reason the Only Oracle of Man (1784), Ballou became Unitarian
(rejected the Trinity). Ballou held, in opposition to the common view of
(at least some 19th century) Universalists, that punishment and reward
occurred in this life, rather than in the next life. He was also an
advocate of the separation of church and state at the state level.
Ballou's perspective on man's sinfulness retained absolute depravity,
but held that God would redeem all in spite of their depravity due to
His love. Later in his life he would reject Christ's deity, believing
instead that Christ had been fully human but chosen by God
(adoptionism). He was the author and editor of several significant works
in the Universalist tradition. (Source: Ernest Cassara, Dictionary of
Unitarian & Universalist Biography)

## Beecher, Edward (Dr.)

Edward Beecher was the son of noted pastor Lyman Beecher. One of his

Jacksonville. He was a leader in the anti-slavery movement, resigning
his presidency in 1844 and going to Salem Street Church as pastor
(Boston, MA). In 1855 he moved to First Congregational Church
(Galesburg, IL) until 1871. He died in 1895. (Source: An American

# What Has Changed?

I do not like when an author updates another individual's work and it is
not clear how the work has changed. I am left with nagging doubts about
the integrity of the work -- in some cases whole chapters have been
removed.

I know I am a bit peculiar in this way and that many are not bothered by
this -- but for those who are I will attempt to lay out some of my
methodology/principles as well as provide a running history of the
changes made.

My goals in contemporizing this work are:

1.  To update antiquated language to more current vocabulary and
    simplify/modernize grammar where appropriate.

2.  To provide additional footnotes that clarify the text -- e.g.,
    giving references to quoted works where they are not provided,
    bringing historical context into view, pointing to other valuable
    works on the topic.

3.  To update the existing footnotes to improve clarity. The
    abbreviations used by 19^th^ century authors leave contemporary
    readers confounded. I attempt to provide the full information
    regarding various works where abbreviations have been used.

4.  To provide biographical information regarding the various
    authorities Hanson quotes. These were often household names in the
    19^th^ century but unfamiliar to us today.

5.  To compare biographical details provided by Hanson with that of
    contemporary and orthodox Christian authors.

6.  To compare/contrast contemporary translations of the quotations from
    Ancient Church Fathers Hanson provides with those available in more
    contemporary editions.

7.  Add footnotes illustrating the orthodox counterargument to Hanson's
    universalistic beliefs.

I'd like for the work to eventually serve as something of a historical
survey of Christianity's struggle over universalism in early history
through the 19^th^ century.

# Changing of Particular Words

I have not noted everywhere I have changed words -- there are far to
many "thee" and "ye" throughout the work that have been changed. I have
attempted to note where I have changed words of more substance as can be
found below.

[^1]: DM: That is, a Doctor of Divinity.

[^2]: DM: The full verse in English is "And when all things have been
    subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to
    him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in
    all."

[^3]: DM: Even with the hopeful vision of God presented in universalism
    I find my faith faltering and often absent due to the tremendous
    suffering here and now. I do not understand how God has allowed,
    continues to allow the suffering that occurs. I do not understand
    how God can redeem that suffering, but this is for another time,
    perhaps another book.

[^4]: DM: One of the better, if more wordy defenses of a deterministic
    perspective is Jonathan Edward's classic *Freedom of the Will*. As I
    slowly grow older I find myself convicted of hubris in determining
    that free will does not exist. The fact that I can logically not
    comprehend it's existence does not mean it does not exist. I find
    myself much more ready to accept that I am greatly limited in my
    capacity to understand reality.

[^5]: DM: I shudder to use the term "Universalism" as it comes loaded
    with preconcepts to our minds. I use the term "Christian" to
    distinguish this from a more general "Universalism", perhaps I could
    also say "Scriptural Universalism." Still, I hope you will choose to
    read on even as certain loaded terms as used.

[^6]: DM: The "doctrine of the final holiness of all mankind" is one of
    several phrases or terms used to describe "Christian Universalism"
    -- and it would be preferable if some such term or phrase could be
    adopted in our present times, due to the frequent confusion of
    "Christian Universalism" with more generic "Universalism" which
    leaves aside the Christian Scriptures and the centrality of Christ.

[^7]: DM: I have attempted to maintain as much of the original language
    as possible but have also taken liberties in making corrections
    where I felt confident the meaning of the text would not be obscured
    and the clarity of the text would be significantly improved.

[^8]: DM: Original: "irrefragable."

[^9]: DM: Original: "inasmuch as."

[^10]: DM: Is this true? Is anyone aware of universalistic beliefs
    predating the advent of Christ?

[^11]: DM: Published in Boston in 1828, 1842, 1872.

[^12]: DM: Hosea Ballou uses this phrase to describe Martin Luther in
    his sermon on "The New Birth" delivered in Boston on the third
    "Sabbath" (it seems likely that this is used of Sunday, rather than
    per its technical meaning -- Saturday) of January, 1820 (See *Select
    Sermons* by Ballou, pg. 101). It is also mentioned in The Signs of
    the Times Vol. 12, No. 24 (June 24, 1886) and in W.H. Withrow's
    *Religious Progress in the Century*, but in neither case is it
    referring to Hosea Ballou.

[^13]: DM: Those early church fathers who knew the original apostles --
    this generally includes Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch,
    Polycarp of Smyrna, and two works of unknown authorship -- *The
    Didache* and *The Shepherd of Hermas*.

[^14]: DM: The Gnostics, at least some of them, were known for their
    belief that the physical world was evil and only the spiritual pure.
    That the supreme God had not created the earth but a lesser god, an
    emanation from the supreme God. In addition, they believe that
    special/secret knowledge (*gnosis*) was necessary for salvation.

[^15]: DM: Samuel Hulme wrote a *Memoir of the Rev. Thomas Allin*
    (1881).

[^16]: DM: This is probably a reference to *A Dictionary of Christian
    Biography, Literature, Sects, and Doctrines* which consisted of four
    volumes published between 1877 and 1887 and was edited by Henry Wace
    and William Smith. It was further revised in a 1911 title of similar
    name, but this would have been published after Hanson wrote.

[^17]: DM: John Wesley Hanson.

[^18]: DM: Original: "irrefragable."

[^19]: DM: See Appendix A for more information on the various
    authorities referenced throughout this work.

[^20]: JW: ΔΙΔΑΧΗ ΤΩΝ ΔΩΔΕΚΑ ΑΙΙΟΣΤΟΑΩΝ

[^21]: DM: Contemporaneously perhaps best known for his classic work,
    Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary.

[^22]: DM: Best known as Brown in Brown Driver Briggs' A Hebrew and
    English Lexicon of the Old Testament.

[^23]: DM: Hanson uses the Greek *aeonian* instead of the English
    eternal to demonstrate his belief that the Greek word *aeonian* was
    of limited duration.

[^24]: DM: Matthew 25:31.

[^25]: DM: Original: "in fine"

[^26]: DM: The Apostle's Creed does not include any statement supporting
    universalism but also lacks any mention of eternal punishment.

[^27]: JW/DM: *Text-book of Christian Doctrine; Gieseler's Text Book:
    Neander.* -- the first might be *A Text-book of the History of
    Doctrines* (1861) or *A History of Christian Doctrines* (1881).

    Johann Lorenz Mosheim's *Institutes of Ecclesiastical History* (3
    Volumes).

[^30]: JW: Aionion, the original of "everlasting."

[^31]: JW: The Apostle's Creed at first omitted the Fatherhood of God,
    and in its later forms did not mention God's love for men, his
    reign, repentance, or the new life. Athanase Conquerel the Younger,
    First Historical Transformations of Christianity, pg. 208.

[^32]: JW: *History of Opinions on the Scriptural Doctrine of
    Retribution*, pp. 198-205.

[^33]: DM: Known these days as annihilationism.

[^34]: JW: See Lamson's *Church of the First Three Centuries*.

[^35]: DM: From the *Ante-Nicene Fathers*, Vol III, Chapter XLI: "Thus
    some men are very bad, and some very good; but yet the souls of all
    form but one genus: even in the worst there is something good, and
    in the best there is something bad." (pp. 220-221)

[^36]: DM: From August Neander's *Lectures on the History of Christian
    Dogmas*, Volume 1, pg. 184.

[^37]: DM: As with The Apostle's Creed, the Nicene Creed is not
    universalist in perspective. Hanson is again noting the lack of a
    doctrine of eternal punishment in the creed as in favor of
    universalism.

[^38]: DM: For background and the text of the Nicene Creed see
    Encyclopedia Britannica's article on the same. URL:
    <https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nicene-Creed>

[^39]: DM: This appears to be a quote from Thomas Allin's Universalism
    Assertred: On the Authority of Reason, the Fathers, & Holy Scripture
    (1887).

[^40]: JW: See Socrates' Ecclesiastical History.

[^44]: DM: 2 Corinthians 5:19.

[^45]: DM: Original: "insupposable."

[^46]: JW: The germ of all the earlier declarations of faith had been
    formulated even before 150 AD. The reader can here consult the
    original Greek of the earliest declaration of faith as given in
    Harnack's *Outlines of the History of Dogma*, Funk & Wagnall's
    edition of 1893, pp. 44, 45.

    *πιστεύω εἰς θεὸν πατέρα παντοκράτορα. καὶ εἰς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν, υἱὸν
    αὐτοῦ τὸν μοναγενῆ, τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν, τὸν γεννηθέντα ἐκ πνεύματος
    ἁγίου καὶ Μαρίας τῆς παρθένου, τὸν ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πιλάτου σταυρωθέντα
    καὶ ταφέντα, τῆ τρίτη ἠμέρᾳ ἀναστάντα έκ νεκρῶν, ἀναβάντα εἰς τοὺς
    οὐρανοὺς, καθ ήμενον έν δεξιᾷ τοῦ πατρὸς, ὅθεν ἔρϰεται κρῖναι ζῶντας
    καὶ νκερούς. καὶ εἰς πνεῦμα ἅγιον, ἁγίαν ἐκκλησίαν, ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν,
    σαρκὸς ἀνάστασιν*.

[^47]: JW: Martial, Juvenal, Tacitus, Pliny, Suetonius, and other
    heathen writers, describe the well-nigh universal depravity and
    depression of the so-called civilized world. In Corinth the
    Acrocorinthus was occupied by a temple to the goddess of lust.

[^48]: DM: Probably Hippolyte Taine, a French historian.

[^49]: DM: This sentiment appears to some extent even within the Old
    Testament, for example Ecclesiastes 4:2-3. This position is now
    called antinatalism and an overview of the topic along with some
    historical notes can be found in Masahiro Morioka's "What is
    Antinatalism?: Definition, History, and Categories (published in
    *The Review of Life Studies* Vol. 12 (May 2021), pp. 1-39. One can

[^50]: JW: See Gerhard Uhlhorn's *Conflict of Christianity and

    ardent opponent of universalism and authored a book on the subject
    in 1885, *The Doctrine of Endless Punishment.*

[^67]: JW: Allen, *Christian Thought*.

[^68]: JW: The early Christians never transferred the rigidity of the
    Jewish Sabbath to Sunday. Both Saturday and Sunday were observed
    religiously till towards the end of the second century---then Sunday
    alone was kept. Fasting and even kneeling in prayer was forbidden on
    Sunday with the early Christians. Ancient writers always mean
    Saturday by the word "Sabbath."

[^69]: DM: From E. H. Plumptre's sermon "The Spirits in Prison", see the
    volume of the same name published in 1871.

[^70]: DM: Probably a reference to Joseph Milner's *The History of the
    Church of Christ*, 1800.

[^71]: DM: Henry Hart Milman. *The History of Christianity*... 1867, pg.
    209.

[^72]: JW: The Emperor Maximin in one of his edicts says that "Almost
    all had abandoned the worship of their ancestors for the new faith."

[^73]: DM: Not a direct quote, but appears to be from Justin Martyr's
    *Dialogue with Trypho the Jew*. See Henry Brown's book of the same
    name, 1846, pg. 250.

    castella, municipia, conciliabula, castra ipsa, tribus, decurias,
    palatium, senatum, forum. Apol. c.* XXXVII. Mosheim, however, thinks
    that the "African orator," who is inclined to exaggerate,
    "rhetoricates" a little here. The Primitive Christians exulted at
    the wonderful progress and diffusion of the Gospel.

[^75]: DM: Edmond de Pressensé. *The Early Years of Christianity*,
    Volume 2. 1871, pg. 53.

[^76]: DM: This seems to imply that Hanson held a heterodox perspective
    on the Trinity.

[^77]: DM: Hanson doesn't include a citation for this quote. A little
    exploration reveals that an author Hanson relies on (Cave,
    *Primitive Christianity*, 1840) uses the quote (pg iv) and includes
    in the footnotes the Latin original. Since the source was not
    provided it seems Hanson was unable to discover it. I've been able
    to trace the quote down to a letter from Jerome to Demetrias. You
    can read a translation as well as the original here:

[^78]: DM: This appears to be from Milman's *History of Latin

    Christianity*.

    kind of men who sometimes controlled the scholarship and opinions of
    the period. When the patriarch Julian was dying he dreamed that his
    successor would come the next day, and bring him a bunch of grapes.
    Next day this Demetrius came with his bunch of grapes, an ignorant
    rustic, and he was soon after seated in the episcopal chair. It was
    this ignoramus who tyrannically assumed control of ecclesiastical
    affairs, censured Origen, and compelled bishops of his own
    appointing to pass a sentence of degradation on Origin, which the
    legitimate presbyters had refused.
